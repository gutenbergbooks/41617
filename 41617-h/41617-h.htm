<h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>

  <p>Too frequently it is the custom to regard the study of the science of
  Armory as that of a subject which has passed beyond the limits of
  practical politics. Heraldry has been termed "the shorthand of History,"
  but nevertheless the study of that shorthand has been approached too
  often as if it were but the study of a dead language. The result has been
  that too much faith has been placed in the works of older writers, whose
  dicta have been accepted as both unquestionably correct at the date they
  wrote, and, as a consequence, equally binding at the present day.</p>

  <p>Since the "Boke of St. Albans" was written, into the heraldic portion
  of which the author managed to compress an unconscionable amount of
  rubbish, books and treatises on the subject of Armory have issued from
  the press in a constant succession. A few of them stand a head and
  shoulders above the remainder. The said remainder have already sunk into
  oblivion. Such a book as "Guillim" must of necessity rank in the
  forefront of any armorial bibliography; but any one seeking to judge the
  Armory of the present day by the standards and ethics adopted by that
  writer, would find himself making mistake after mistake, and led
  hopelessly astray. There can be very little doubt that the "Display of
  Heraldry" is an accurate representation of the laws of Armory which
  governed the use of Arms at the date the book was written; and it
  correctly puts forward the opinions which were then accepted concerning
  the past history of the science.</p>

  <p>There are two points, however, which must be borne in mind.</p>

  <p>The first is that the critical desire for accuracy which fortunately
  seems to have been the keynote of research during the nineteenth century,
  has produced students of Armory whose investigations into facts have
  swept away the fables, the myths, and the falsehood which had collected
  around the ancient science, and which in their preposterous assertions
  had earned for Armory a ridicule, a contempt, and a disbelief which the
  science itself, and moreover the active practice of the science, had
  never at any time warranted or deserved. The desire to gratify the vanity
  of illustrious patrons rendered the mythical traditions attached to
  Armory more difficult to explode than in the cases of those other
  sciences in which no one has a personal interest in <!-- Page x --><span
  class="pagenum" title="012.png"><a name="pagex"></a>{x}</span>upholding
  the wrong; but a study of the scientific works of bygone days, and the
  comparison, for example, of a sixteenth or seventeenth century medical
  book with a similar work of the present day, will show that all
  scientific knowledge during past centuries was a curious conglomeration
  of unquestionable fact, interwoven with and partly obscured by a vast
  amount of false information, which now can either be dismissed as utter
  rubbish or controverted and disproved on the score of being plausible
  untruth. Consequently, Armory, no less than medicine, theology, or
  jurisprudence, should not be lightly esteemed because our predecessors
  knew less about the subject than is known at the present day, or because
  they believed implicitly dogma and tradition which we ourselves know to
  be and accept as exploded. Research and investigation constantly goes on,
  and every day adds to our knowledge.</p>

  <p>The second point, which perhaps is the most important, is the patent
  fact that Heraldry and Armory are not a dead science, but are an actual
  living reality. Armory may be a quaint survival of a time with different
  manners and customs, and different ideas from our own, but the word
  "Finis" has not yet been written to the science, which is still slowly
  developing and altering and changing as it is suited to the altered
  manners and customs of the present day. I doubt not that this view will
  be a startling one to many who look upon Armory as indissolubly
  associated with parchments and writings already musty with age. But so
  long as the Sovereign has the power to create a new order of Knighthood,
  and attach thereto Heraldic insignia, so long as the Crown has the power
  to create a new coronet, or to order a new ceremonial, so long as new
  coats of arms are being called into being,&mdash;for so long is it idle
  to treat Armory and Heraldry as a science incapable of further
  development, or as a science which in recent periods has not altered in
  its laws.</p>

  <p>The many mistaken ideas upon Armory, however, are not all due to the
  two considerations which have been put forward. Many are due to the fact
  that the hand-books of Armory professing to detail the laws of the
  science have not always been written by those having complete knowledge
  of their subject. Some statement appears in a textbook of Armory, it is
  copied into book after book, and accepted by those who study Armory as
  being correct; whilst all the time it is absolutely wrong, and has never
  been accepted or acted upon by the Officers of Arms. One instance will
  illustrate my meaning. There is scarcely a text-book of Armory which does
  not lay down the rule, that when a crest issues from a coronet it must
  not be placed upon a wreath. Now there is no rule whatever upon the
  subject; and instances are frequent, both in ancient and in modern
  grants, in which coronets have been granted to be borne upon wreaths; and
  the wreath should <!-- Page xi --><span class="pagenum" title="013.png"
  ><a name="pagexi"></a>{xi}</span>be inserted or omitted <i>according to
  the original grant of the crest</i>. Consequently, the so-called rule
  must be expunged.</p>

  <p>Another fruitful source of error is the effort which has frequently
  been made to assimilate the laws of Armory prevailing in the three
  different kingdoms into one single series of rules and regulations. Some
  writers have even gone so far as to attempt to assimilate with our own
  the rules and regulations which hold upon the Continent. As a matter of
  fact, many of the laws of Arms in England and Scotland are radically
  different; and care needs to be taken to point out these differences.</p>

  <p>The truest way to ascertain the laws of Armory is by deduction from
  known facts. Nevertheless, such a practice may lead one astray, for the
  number of exceptions to any given rule in Armory is always great, and it
  is sometimes difficult to tell what is the rule, and which are the
  exceptions. Moreover, the Sovereign, as the fountain of honour, can
  over-ride any rule or law of Arms; and many exceptional cases which have
  been governed by specific grants have been accepted in times past as
  demonstrating the laws of Armory, when they have been no more than
  instances of exceptional favour on the part of the Crown.</p>

  <p>In England no one is compelled to bear Arms unless he wishes; but,
  should he desire to do so, the Inland Revenue requires a payment of one
  or two guineas, according to the method of use. From this voluntary
  taxation the yearly revenue exceeds £70,000. This affords pretty clear
  evidence that Armory is still decidedly popular, and that its use and
  display are extensive; but at the same time it would be foolish to
  suppose that the estimation in which Armory is held, is equal to, or
  approaches, the romantic value which in former days was attached to the
  inheritance of Arms. The result of this has been&mdash;and it is not to
  be wondered at&mdash;that ancient examples are accepted and extolled
  beyond what should be the case. It should be borne in mind that the very
  ancient examples of Armory which have come down to us, may be examples of
  the handicraft of ignorant individuals; and it is not safe to accept
  unquestioningly laws of Arms which are deduced from Heraldic
  <i>handicraft</i> of other days. Most of them are correct, because as a
  rule such handicraft was done under supervision; but there is always the
  risk that it has not been; and <i>this risk should be borne in mind</i>
  when estimating the value of any particular example of Armory as proof or
  contradiction of any particular Armorial law. There were "heraldic
  stationers" before the present day.</p>

  <p>A somewhat similar consideration must govern the estimate of the
  Heraldic art of a former day. To every action we are told there is a
  reaction; and the reaction of the present day, admirable and commendable
  as it undoubtedly is, which has taken the art of Armory back to the style
  in vogue in past centuries, needs to be kept within intelligent <!-- Page
  xii --><span class="pagenum" title="014.png"><a
  name="pagexii"></a>{xii}</span>bounds. That the freedom of design and
  draughtsmanship of the old artists should be copied is desirable; but at
  the same time there is not the slightest necessity to copy, and to
  deliberately copy, the crudeness of execution which undoubtedly exists in
  much of the older work. The revulsion from what has been aptly styled
  "the die-sinker school of heraldry" has caused some artists to produce
  Heraldic drawings which (though doubtless modelled upon ancient examples)
  are grotesque to the last degree, and can be described in no other
  way.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I have to repeat my grateful acknowledgments to the
  many individuals who assisted me in the preparation of my "Art of
  Heraldry," upon which this present volume is founded, and whose work I
  have again made use of.</p>

  <p>The very copious index herein is entirely the work of my professional
  clerk, Mr. H. A. Kenward, for which I offer him my thanks. Only those who
  have had actual experience know the tedious weariness of compiling such
  an index.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">A COMPLETE GUIDE TO HERALDRY</h5>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER I</h5>

<h5>THE ORIGIN OF ARMORY</h5>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:21%;">

  </div>
  <p>rmory is that science of which the rules and the laws govern the use,
  display, meaning, and knowledge of the pictured signs and emblems
  appertaining to shield, helmet, or banner. Heraldry has a wider meaning,
  for it comprises everything within the duties of a herald; and whilst
  Armory undoubtedly is Heraldry, the regulation of ceremonials and matters
  of pedigree, which are really also within the scope of Heraldry, most
  decidedly are not Armory.</p>

  <p>"Armory" relates only to the emblems and devices. "Armoury" relates to
  the weapons themselves as weapons of warfare, or to the place used for
  the storing of the weapons. But these distinctions of spelling are
  modern.</p>

  <p>The word "Arms," like many other words in the English language, has
  several meanings, and at the present day is used in several senses. It
  may mean the weapons themselves; it may mean the limbs upon the human
  body. Even from the heraldic point of view it may mean the entire
  achievement, but usually it is employed in reference to the device upon
  the shield only.</p>

  <p>Of the exact origin of arms and armory nothing whatever is definitely
  known, and it becomes difficult to point to any particular period as the
  period covering the origin of armory, for the very simple reason that it
  is much more difficult to decide what is or is not to be admitted as
  armorial. <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum" title="016.png"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span></p>

  <p>Until comparatively recently heraldic books referred armory
  indifferently to the tribes of Israel, to the Greeks, to the Romans, to
  the Assyrians and the Saxons; and we are equally familiar with the "Lion
  of Judah" and the "Eagle of the Cæsars." In other directions we find the
  same sort of thing, for it has ever been the practice of semi-civilised
  nations to bestow or to assume the virtues and the names of animals and
  of deities as symbols of honour. We scarcely need refer to the totems of
  the North American Indians for proof of such a practice. They have
  reduced the subject almost to an exact science; and there cannot be the
  shadow of a doubt that it is to this semi-savage practice that armory is
  to be traced if its origin is to be followed out to its logical and most
  remote beginning. Equally is it certain that many recognised heraldic
  figures, and more particularly those mythical creatures of which the
  armorial menagerie alone has now cognisance, are due to the art of
  civilisations older than our own, and the legends of those civilisations
  which have called these mythical creatures into being.</p>

  <p>The widest definition of armory would have it that any pictorial badge
  which is used by an individual or a family with the meaning that it is a
  badge indicative of that person or family, and adopted and repeatedly
  used in that sense, is heraldic. If such be your definition, you may
  ransack the Scriptures for the arms of the tribes of Israel, the writings
  of the Greek and Roman poets for the decorations of the armour and the
  persons of their heroes, mythical and actual, and you may annex
  numberless "heraldic" instances from the art of Nineveh, of Babylon, and
  of Egypt. Your heraldry is of the beginning and from the beginning. It
  <i>is</i> fact, but is it heraldry? The statement in the "Boke of St.
  Albans" that Christ was a gentleman of coat armour is a fable, and due
  distinction must be had between the fact and the fiction in this as in
  all other similar cases.</p>

  <p>Mr. G. W. Eve, in his "Decorative Heraldry," alludes to and
  illustrates many striking examples of figures of an embryonic type of
  heraldry, of which the best are one from a Chaldean bas-relief 4000 <span
  class="sm">B. C.</span>, the earliest known device that can in any way be
  called heraldic, and another, a device from a Byzantine silk of the tenth
  century. Mr. Eve certainly seems inclined to follow the older heraldic
  writers in giving as wide an interpretation as possible to the word
  heraldic, but it is significant that none of these early instances which
  he gives appear to have any relation to a shield, so that, even if it be
  conceded that the figures are heraldic, they certainly cannot be said to
  be armorial. But doubtless the inclusion of such instances is due to an
  attempt, conscious or unconscious, on the part of the writers who have
  taken their stand on the side of great antiquity to so frame the
  definition of armory that it shall include everything heraldic, and due
  perhaps somewhat to the half unconscious <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="017.png"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>reasoning
  that these mythical animals, and more especially the peculiarly heraldic
  positions they are depicted in, which nowadays we only know as part of
  armory, and which exist nowhere else within our knowledge save within the
  charmed circle of heraldry, must be evidence of the great antiquity of
  that science or art, call it which you will. But it is a false deduction,
  due to a confusion of premise and conclusion. We find certain figures at
  the present day purely heraldic&mdash;we find those figures fifty
  centuries ago. It certainly seems a correct conclusion that, therefore,
  heraldry must be of that age. But is not the real conclusion, that, our
  heraldic figures being so old, it is evident that the figures originated
  long before heraldry was ever thought of, and that instead of these
  mythical figures having been originated by the necessities of heraldry,
  and being part, or even the rudimentary origin of heraldry, they had
  existed <i>for other reasons and purposes</i>&mdash;and that when the
  science of heraldry sprang into being, it found the <i>whole range</i> of
  its forms and charges already existing, and that <i>none</i> of these
  figures owe their being to heraldry? The gryphon is supposed to have
  <i>originated</i>, as is the double-headed eagle, from the dimidiation of
  two coats of arms resulting from impalement by reason of marriage. Both
  these figures were known ages earlier. Thus departs yet another of the
  little fictions which past writers on armory have fostered and
  perpetuated. Whether the ancient Egyptians and Assyrians knew they were
  depicting mythical animals, and did it, intending them to be symbolical
  of attributes of their deities, something beyond what they were familiar
  with in their ordinary life, we do not know; nor indeed have we any
  certain knowledge that there have never been animals of which their
  figures are but imperfect and crude representations.</p>

  <p>But it does not necessarily follow that because an Egyptian artist
  drew a certain figure, which figure is now appropriated to the peculiar
  use of armory, that he knew anything whatever of the laws of armory.
  Further, where is this argument to end? There is nothing peculiarly
  heraldic about the lion passant, statant, dormant, couchant, or salient,
  and though heraldic artists may for the sake of artistic appearance
  distort the brute away from his natural figure, the rampant is alone the
  position which exists not in nature; and if the argument is to be applied
  to the bitter end, heraldry must be taken back to the very earliest
  instance which exists of any representation of a lion. The proposition is
  absurd. The ancient artists drew their lions how they liked, regardless
  of armory and its laws, which did not then exist; and, from decorative
  reasons, they evolved a certain number of methods of depicting the
  positions of <i>e.g.</i> the lion and the eagle to suit their decorative
  purposes. When heraldry came into existence it came in as an adjunct of
  decoration, and it necessarily followed that the whole of the positions
  in which the <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum" title="018.png"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>craftsmen found the eagle or the lion depicted
  were appropriated with the animals for heraldry. That this appropriation
  for the exclusive purposes of armory has been silently acquiesced in by
  the decorative artists of later days is simply proof of the intense power
  and authority which accrued later to armory, and which was in fact
  attached to anything relating to privilege and prerogative. To put it
  baldly, the dominating authority of heraldry and its dogmatic protection
  by the Powers that were, appropriated certain figures to its use, and
  then defied any one to use them for more humble decorative purposes not
  allied with armory. And it is the trail of this autocratic appropriation,
  and from the decorative point of view this arrogant appropriation, which
  can be traced in the present idea that a griffin or a spread eagle, for
  example, must be heraldic. Consequently the argument as to the antiquity
  of heraldry which is founded upon the discovery of the heraldic creature
  in the remote ages goes by the board. One practical instance may perhaps
  more fully demonstrate my meaning. There is one figure, probably the most
  beautiful of all of those which we owe to Egypt, which is now rapidly
  being absorbed into heraldry. I refer to the Sphinx. This, whilst
  strangely in keeping with the remaining mythical heraldic figures, for
  some reason or other escaped the exclusive appropriation of armorial use
  until within modern times. One of the earliest instances of its use in
  recognised armory occurs in the grant to Sir John Moore, K.B., the hero
  of Corunna, and another will be found in the augmentation granted to
  Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, K.B. Since then it has been used on some
  number of occasions. It certainly remained, however, for the late Garter
  King of Arms to evolve from the depths of his imagination a position
  which no Egyptian sphinx ever occupied, when he granted two of them as
  supporters to the late Sir Edward Malet, G.C.B. The Sphinx has also been
  adopted as the badge of one of his Majesty's regiments, and I have very
  little doubt that now Egypt has come under our control the Sphinx will
  figure in some number of the grants of the future to commemorate fortunes
  made in that country, or lifetimes spent in the Egyptian services. If
  this be so, the dominating influence of armory will doubtless in the
  course of another century have given to the Sphinx, as it has to many
  other objects, a distinctly heraldic nature and character in the mind of
  the "man in the street" to which we nowadays so often refer the
  arbitrament between conflicting opinions. Perhaps in the even yet more
  remote future, when the world in general accepts as a fact that armory
  did not exist at the time of the Norman Conquest, we shall have some
  interesting and enterprising individual writing a book to demonstrate
  that because the Sphinx existed in Egypt long before the days of
  Cleopatra, heraldry must of necessity be equally antique. <!-- Page 5
  --><span class="pagenum" title="019.png"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span></p>

  <p>I have no wish, however, to dismiss thus lightly the subject of the
  antiquity of heraldry, because there is one side of the question which I
  have not yet touched upon, and that is, the symbolism of these ancient
  and so-called heraldic examples. There is no doubt whatever that
  symbolism forms an integral part of armory; in fact there is no doubt
  that armory <i>itself</i> as a whole is nothing more or less than a kind
  of symbolism. I have no sympathy whatever with many of the ideas
  concerning this symbolism, which will be found in nearly all heraldic
  books before the day of the late J. R. Planché, Somerset Herald, who
  fired the train which exploded then and for ever the absurd ideas of
  former writers. That an argent field meant purity, that a field of gules
  meant royal or even martial ancestors, that a saltire meant the capture
  of a city, or a lion rampant noble and enviable qualities, I utterly
  deny. But that nearly every coat of arms for any one of the name of
  Fletcher bears upon it in some form or another an arrow or an arrow-head,
  because the origin of the name comes from the occupation of the fletcher,
  who was an arrow-maker, is true enough. Symbolism of that kind will be
  found constantly in armory, as in the case of the foxes and foxes' heads
  in the various coats of Fox, the lions in the coats of arms of Lyons, the
  horse in the arms of Trotter, and the acorns in the arms of Oakes; in
  fact by far the larger proportion of the older coats of arms, where they
  can be traced to their real origin, exhibit some such derivation. There
  is another kind of symbolism which formerly, and still, favours the
  introduction of swords and spears and bombshells into grants of arms to
  military men, that gives bezants to bankers and those connected with
  money, and that assigns woolpacks and cotton-plants to the shields of
  textile merchants; but that is a sane and reasonable symbolism, which the
  reputed symbolism of the earlier heraldry books was not.</p>

  <p>It has yet to be demonstrated, however, though the belief is very
  generally credited, that all these very ancient Egyptian and Assyrian
  figures of a heraldic character had anything of symbolism about them. But
  even granting the whole symbolism which is claimed for them, we get but
  little further. There is no doubt that the eagle from untold ages has had
  an imperial symbolism which it still possesses. But that symbolism is not
  necessarily heraldic, and it is much more probable that heraldry
  appropriated both the eagle and its symbolism ready made, and together:
  consequently, if, as we have shown, the <i>existence</i> of the eagle is
  not proof of the coeval existence of heraldry, no more is the existence
  of the <i>symbolical</i> imperial eagle. For if we are to regard all
  symbolism as heraldic, where are we either to begin or to end? Church
  vestments and ecclesiastical emblems are symbolism run riot; in fact they
  are little else: but by no stretch of imagination can these be <!-- Page
  6 --><span class="pagenum" title="020.png"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>considered heraldic with the exception of the
  few (for example the crosier, the mitre, and the pallium) which heraldry
  has appropriated ready made. Therefore, though heraldry appropriated
  ready made from other decorative art, and from nature and handicraft, the
  whole of its charges, and though it is evident heraldry also appropriated
  ready made a great deal of its symbolism, neither the earlier existence
  of the forms which it appropriated, nor the earlier existence of their
  symbolism, can be said to weigh at all as determining factors in the
  consideration of the age of heraldry. Sloane Evans in his "Grammar of
  Heraldry" (p. ix.) gives the following instances as evidence of the
  greater antiquity, and they are worthy at any rate of attention if the
  matter is to be impartially considered.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The antiquity of ensigns and symbols may be proved by reference to
  Holy Writ.</p>

  <p>"1. 'Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
  Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the
  number of their names.... And they assembled all the congregation
  together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their
  pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
  to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward.... And the
  children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp,
  and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts' (Numbers i. 2,
  18, 52).</p>

  <p>"2. 'Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
  standard, with the ensign of their father's house' (Numbers ii. 2).</p>

  <p>"3. 'And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord
  commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set
  forward, every one after their families, according to the house of their
  fathers' (Numbers ii. 34)."</p>

  <p>Potter in his "Antiquities of Greece" (Dunbar's edition, Edinburgh,
  1824, vol. ii. page 79), thus speaks of the ensigns or flags (<span
  title="sêmeia" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&alpha;</span>) used by the Grecians in
  their military affairs: "Of these there were different sorts, several of
  which were adorned with images of animals, or other things bearing
  peculiar relations to the cities they belong to. The Athenians, for
  instance, bore an owl in their ensigns (Plutarchus Lysandro), as being
  sacred to Minerva, the protectress of their city; the Thebans a
  <i>Sphynx</i> (<i>idem</i> Pelopidas, Cornelius Nepos, Epaminondas), in
  memory of the famous monster overcome by &OElig;dipus. The Persians paid
  divine honours to the sun, and therefore represented him in their
  ensigns" (Curtius, lib. 3). Again (in page 150), speaking of the
  ornaments and devices on their ships, he says: "Some other things there
  are in the prow and stern that deserve our notice, as those ornaments
  wherewith the extremities of the ship were beautified, commonly called
  <span title="akronea" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&epsilon;&alpha;</span> (or <span
  title="neôn korônides" class="grk">&nu;&epsilon;&#x1FF6;&nu;
  &kappa;&omicron;&rho;&omega;&nu;&#x1F77;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>),
  in Latin, <i>Corymbi</i>. The form of them sometimes represented helmets,
  sometimes living creatures, but most frequently was winded into a round
  compass, whence they are so commonly named <i>Corymbi</i> and
  <i>Coronæ</i>. To the <span title="akrostolia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F79;&lambda;&iota;&alpha;</span>
  in the prow, answered the <span title="aphgasta" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&phi;&gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;</span> in the stern,
  which were often of an orbicular figure, or fashioned like wings, to
  which a little shield called <span title="aspideion" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&sigma;&pi;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
  or <span title="aspidiskê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&sigma;&pi;&iota;&delta;&#x1F77;&sigma;&kappa;&eta;</span>, was
  frequently affixed; sometimes a piece of wood was erected, whereon
  ribbons of divers colours were hung, and served instead of a flag to
  distinguish the ship. <span title="Chêniskos" class="grk"
  >&Chi;&eta;&nu;&#x1F77;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> was so
  called from <span title="Chên" class="grk">&Chi;&#x1F74;&nu;</span>, <i>a
  Goose</i>, whose <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum" title="024.png"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>figure it resembled, because geese were
  looked on as fortunate omens to mariners, for that they swim on the top
  of the waters and sink not. <span title="Parasêmon" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&alpha;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;</span> was the
  flag whereby ships were distinguished from one another; it was placed in
  the prow, just below the <span title="stolos" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&#x1F79;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, being sometimes
  carved, and frequently painted, whence it is in Latin termed
  <i>pictura</i>, representing the form of a <i>mountain</i>, a
  <i>tree</i>, a <i>flower</i>, or any other thing, wherein it was
  distinguished from what was called <i>tutela</i>, or the safeguard of the
  ship, which always represented <i>some one of the gods</i>, to whose care
  and protection the ship was recommended; for which reason it was held
  sacred. Now and then we find the <i>tutela</i> taken for the <span
  title="Parasêmon" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&alpha;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;</span>, and
  perhaps sometimes the images of gods might be represented on the flags;
  by some it is placed also in the prow, but by most authors of credit
  assigned to the stern. Thus Ovid in his Epistle to Paris:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Accipit et pictos puppis adunca Deos.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'The stern with painted deities richly shines.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"The ship wherein Europa was conveyed from Ph&oelig;nicia into Crete
  had a <i>bull</i> for its flag, and <i>Jupiter</i> for its tutelary
  deity. The B&oelig;otian ships had for their tutelar god <i>Cadmus</i>,
  represented with a <i>dragon</i> in his hand, because he was the founder
  of Thebes, the principal city of B&oelig;otia. The name of the ship was
  usually taken from the flag, as appears in the following passage of Ovid,
  where he tells us his ship received its name from the helmet painted upon
  it:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Est mihi, sitque, precor, flavæ tutela Minervæ,</p>
      <p>Navis et à pictâ casside nomen habit.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Minerva is the goddess I adore,</p>
      <p>And may she grant the blessings I implore;</p>
      <p>The ship its name a painted helmet gives.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Hence comes the frequent mention of ships called <i>Pegasi</i>,
  <i>Scyllæ</i>, <i>Bulls</i>, <i>Rams</i>, <i>Tigers</i>, &amp;c., which
  the poets took liberty to represent as living creatures that transported
  their riders from one country to another; nor was there (according to
  some) any other ground for those known fictions of Pegasus, the winged
  Bellerophon, or the Ram which is reported to have carried Phryxus to
  Colchos."</p>

  <p>To quote another very learned author: "The system of hieroglyphics, or
  symbols, was adopted into every mysterious institution, for the purpose
  of concealing the most sublime secrets of religion from the prying
  curiosity of the vulgar; to whom nothing was exposed but the beauties of
  their morality." (See Ramsay's "Travels of Cyrus," lib. 3.) "The old
  Asiatic style, so highly figurative, seems, by what we find of <!-- Page
  11 --><span class="pagenum" title="025.png"><a
  name="page11"></a>{11}</span>its remains in the prophetic language of the
  sacred writers, to have been evidently fashioned to the mode of the
  ancient hieroglyphics; for as in hieroglyphic writing the sun, moon, and
  stars were used to represent states and empires, kings, queens, and
  nobility&mdash;their eclipse and extinction, temporary disasters, or
  entire overthrow&mdash;fire and flood, desolation by war and famine;
  plants or animals, the qualities of particular persons, &amp;c.; so, in
  like manner, the Holy Prophets call kings and empires by the names of the
  heavenly luminaries; their misfortunes and overthrow are represented by
  eclipses and extinction; stars falling from the firmament are employed to
  denote the destruction of the nobility; thunder and tempestuous winds,
  hostile invasions; lions, bears, leopards, goats, or high trees, leaders
  of armies, conquerors, and founders of empires; royal dignity is
  described by purple, or a crown; iniquity by spotted garments; a warrior
  by a sword or bow; a powerful man, by a gigantic stature; a judge by
  balance, weights, and measures&mdash;in a word, the prophetic style seems
  to be a speaking hieroglyphic."</p>

  <p>It seems to me, however, that the whole of these are no more than
  symbolism, though they are undoubtedly symbolism of a high and methodical
  order, little removed from our own armory. Personally I do not consider
  them to be armory, but if the word is to be stretched to the utmost
  latitude to permit of their inclusion, one certain conclusion follows.
  That if the heraldry of that day had an orderly existence, it most
  certainly came absolutely to an end and disappeared. Armory as we know
  it, the armory of to-day, which as a system is traced back to the period
  of the Crusades, is no mere continuation by adoption. It is a distinct
  development and a re-development <i>ab initio</i>. Undoubtedly there is a
  period in the early development of European civilisation which is
  destitute alike of armory, or of anything of that nature. The
  civilisation of Europe is not the civilisation of Egypt, of Greece, or of
  Rome, nor a continuation thereof, but a new development, and though each
  of these in its turn attained a high degree of civilisation and may have
  separately developed a heraldic symbolism much akin to armory, as a
  natural consequence of its own development, as the armory we know is a
  development of its own consequent upon the rise of our own civilisation,
  nevertheless it is unjustifiable to attempt to establish continuity
  between the ordered symbolism of earlier but distinct civilisations, and
  our own present system of armory. The one and only civilisation which has
  preserved its continuity is that of the Jewish race. In spite of
  persecution the Jews have preserved unchanged the minutest details of
  ritual law and ceremony, the causes of their suffering. Had heraldry,
  which is and has always been a matter of pride, formed a part of their
  distinctive life we should find it still existing. Yet the fact remains
  <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum" title="026.png"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>that no trace of Jewish heraldry can be
  found until modern times. Consequently I accept unquestioningly the
  conclusions of the late J. R. Planché, Somerset Herald, who
  unhesitatingly asserted that armory did not exist at the time of the
  Conquest, basing his conclusions principally upon the entire absence of
  armory from the seals of that period, and the Bayeux tapestry.</p>

  <p>The family tokens (<i>mon</i>) of the Japanese, however, fulfil very
  nearly all of the essentials of armory, although considered heraldically
  they may appear somewhat peculiar to European eyes. Though perhaps never
  forming the entire decoration of a shield, they do appear upon weapons
  and armour, and are used most lavishly in the decoration of clothing,
  rooms, furniture, and in fact almost every conceivable object, being
  employed for <i>decorative</i> purposes in precisely the same manners and
  methods that armorial devices are decoratively made use of in this
  country. A Japanese of the upper classes always has his <i>mon</i> in
  three places upon his <i>kimono</i>, usually at the back just below the
  collar and on either sleeve. The Japanese servants also wear their
  service badge in much the same manner that in olden days the badge was
  worn by the servants of a nobleman. The design of the service badge
  occupies the whole available surface of the back, and is reproduced in a
  miniature form on each lappel of the <i>kimono</i>. Unfortunately, like
  armorial bearings in Europe, but to a far greater extent, the Japanese
  <i>mon</i> has been greatly pirated and abused. <!-- Page 13 --><span

  <p>The Saracens and the Moors, to whom we owe the origin of so many of
  our recognised heraldic charges and the derivation of some of our terms
  (<i>e.g.</i> "gules," from the Persian <i>gul</i>, and "azure" from the
  Persian <i>lazurd</i>) had evidently on their part something more than
  the rudiments of armory, as Figs. 6 to 11 will indicate. <!-- Page 14
  --><span class="pagenum" title="028.png"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span></p>

  <p>One of the best definitions of a coat of arms that I know, though this
  is not perfect, requires the twofold qualification that the design must
  be hereditary and must be connected with armour. And there can be no
  doubt that the theory of armory as we now know it is governed by those
  two ideas. The shields and the crests, if any decoration of a helmet is
  to be called a crest, of the Greeks and the Romans undoubtedly come
  within the one requirement. Also were they indicative of and perhaps
  intended to be symbolical of the owner. They lacked, however, heredity,
  and we have no proof that the badges we read of, or the decorations of
  shield and helmet, were continuous even during a single lifetime.
  Certainly as we now understand the term there must be both continuity of
  use, if the arms be impersonal, or heredity if the arms be personal.
  Likewise must there be their use as decorations of the implements of
  warfare.</p>

  <p>If we exact these qualifications as essential, armory as a fact and as
  a science is a product of later days, and is the evolution from the idea
  of tribal badges and tribal means and methods of honour applied to the
  decoration of implements of warfare. It is the conjunction and
  association of these two distinct ideas to which is added the no less
  important idea of heredity. The civilisation of England before the
  Conquest has left us no trace of any sort or kind that the Saxons, the
  Danes, or the Celts either knew or practised armory. So that if armory as
  we know it is to be traced to the period of the Norman Conquest, we must
  look for it as an adjunct of the altered civilisation and the altered law
  which Duke William brought into this country. Such evidence as exists is
  to the contrary, and there is nothing that can be truly termed armorial
  in that marvellous piece of cotemporaneous workmanship known as the
  Bayeux tapestry.</p>

  <p>Concerning the Bayeux tapestry and the evidence it affords, Woodward
  and Burnett's "Treatise on Heraldry," apparently following Planché's
  conclusions, remarks: "The evidence afforded by the famous tapestry
  preserved in the public library of Bayeux, a series of views in sewed
  work representing the invasion and conquest of England by <span
  class="sc">William</span> the Norman, has been appealed to on both sides
  of this controversy, and has certainly an important bearing on the
  question of the antiquity of coat-armour. This panorama of seventy-two
  scenes is on probable grounds believed to have been the work of the
  Conqueror's Queen <span class="sc">Matilda</span> and her maidens; though
  the French historian <span class="sc">Thierry</span> and others ascribe
  it to the Empress <span class="sc">Maud</span>, daughter of <span
  class="sc">Henry III</span>. The latest authorities suggest the
  likelihood of its having been wrought as a decoration for the Cathedral
  of Bayeux, when rebuilt by <span class="sc">William's</span> uterine
  brother <span class="sc">Odo</span>, Bishop of that See, in 1077. The
  exact correspondence which has been discovered between the length of the
  tapestry <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum" title="029.png"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>and the inner circumference of the nave of
  the cathedral greatly favours this supposition. This remarkable work of
  art, as carefully drawn in colour in 1818 by Mr. <span class="sc">C.
  Stothard</span>, is reproduced in the sixth volume of the <i>Vetusta
  Monumenta</i>; and more recently an excellent copy of it from autotype
  plates has been published by the Arundel Society. Each of its scenes is
  accompanied by a Latin description, the whole uniting into a graphic
  history of the event commemorated. We see <span class="sc">Harold</span>
  taking leave of <span class="sc">Edward the Confessor</span>; riding to
  Bosham with his hawk and hounds; embarking for France; landing there and
  being captured by the Count of Ponthieu; redeemed by <span
  class="sc">William</span> of Normandy, and in the midst of his Court
  aiding him against <span class="sc">Conan</span>, Count of <span
  class="sc">Bretagne</span>; swearing on the sacred relics to recognise
  <span class="sc">William's</span> claim of succession to the English
  throne, and then re-embarking for England. On his return, we have him
  recounting the incidents of his journey to <span class="sc">Edward the
  Confessor</span>, to whose funeral obsequies we are next introduced. Then
  we have <span class="sc">Harold</span> receiving the crown from the
  English people, and ascending the throne; and <span
  class="sc">William</span>, apprised of what had taken place, consulting
  with his half-brother <span class="sc">Odo</span> about invading England.
  The war preparations of the Normans, their embarkation, their landing,
  their march to Hastings, and formation of a camp there, form the subjects
  of successive scenes; and finally we have the battle of Hastings, with
  the death of Harold and the flight of the English. In this remarkable
  piece of work we have figures of more than six hundred persons, and seven
  hundred animals, besides thirty-seven buildings, and forty-one ships or
  boats. There are of course also numerous shields of warriors, of which
  some are round, others kite-shaped, and on some of the latter are rude
  figures, of dragons or other imaginary animals, as well as crosses of
  different forms, and spots. On one hand it requires little imagination to
  find the cross <i>patée</i> and the cross <i>botonnée</i> of heraldry
  prefigured on two of these shields. But there are several fatal
  objections to regarding these figures as incipient <i>armory</i>, namely
  that while the most prominent persons of the time are depicted, most of
  them repeatedly, none of these is ever represented twice as bearing the
  same device, nor is there one instance of any resemblance in the rude
  designs described to the bearings actually used by the descendants of the
  persons in question. If a personage so important and so often depicted as
  the Conqueror had borne arms, they could not fail to have had a place in
  a nearly contemporary work, and more especially if it proceeded from the
  needle of his wife."</p>

  <p>Lower, in his "Curiosities of Heraldry," clinches the argument when he
  writes: "Nothing but disappointment awaits the curious armorist who seeks
  in this venerable memorial the pale, the bend, and <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="030.png"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>other
  early elements of arms. As these would have been much more easily
  imitated with the needle than the grotesque figures before alluded to, we
  may safely conclude that personal arms had not yet been introduced." The
  "Treatise on Heraldry" proceeds: "The Second Crusade took place in 1147;
  and in <span class="sc">Montfaucon's</span> plates of the no longer
  extant windows of the Abbey of St. Denis, representing that historical
  episode, there is not a trace of an armorial ensign on any of the
  shields. That window was probably executed at a date when the memory of
  that event was fresh; but in <span class="sc">Montfaucon's</span> time,
  the beginning of the eighteenth century, the <i>Science héroïque</i> was
  matter of such moment in France that it is not to be believed that the
  armorial figures on the shields, had there been any, would have been left
  out."</p>

  <p>Surely, if anywhere, we might have expected to have found evidence of
  armory, if it had then existed, in the Bayeux Tapestry. Neither do the
  seals nor the coins of the period produce a shield of arms. Nor amongst
  the host of records and documents which have been preserved to us do we
  find any reference to armorial bearings. The intense value and estimation
  attached to arms in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which has
  steadily though slowly declined since that period, would lead one to
  suppose that had arms existed as we know them at an earlier period, we
  should have found some definite record of them in the older chronicles.
  There are no such references, and no coat of arms in use at a later date
  can be relegated to the Conquest or any anterior period. Of arms, as we
  know them, there are <i>isolated examples</i> in the early part of the
  twelfth century, <i>perhaps</i> also at the end of the eleventh. At the
  period of the Third Crusade (1189) they were in actual existence as
  hereditary decorations of weapons of warfare.</p>

  <p>Luckily, for the purposes of deductive reasoning, human nature remains
  much the same throughout the ages, and, dislike it as we may, vanity now
  and vanity in olden days was a great lever in the determination of human
  actions. A noticeable result of civilisation is the effort to suppress
  any sign of natural emotion; and if the human race at the present day is
  not unmoved by a desire to render its appearance attractive, we may rest
  very certainly assured that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries this
  motive was even more pronounced, and still yet more pronounced at a more
  remote distance of time. Given an opportunity of ornament, there you will
  find ornament and decoration. The ancient Britons, like the Maories of
  to-day, found their opportunities restricted to their skins. The Maories
  tattoo themselves in intricate patterns, the ancient Britons used woad,
  though history is silent as to whether they were content with flat colour
  or gave their preference to patterns. It is unnecessary to trace the art
  of <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum" title="031.png"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>decoration through embroidery upon clothes,
  but there is no doubt that as soon as shields came into use they were
  painted and decorated, though I hesitate to follow practically the whole
  of heraldic writers in the statement that it was <i>the necessity for
  distinction in battle</i> which accounted for the decoration of shields.
  Shields were painted and decorated, and helmets were adorned with all
  sorts of ornament, long <i>before</i> the closed helmet made it
  impossible to recognise a man by his facial peculiarities and
  distinctions. We have then this underlying principle of vanity, with its
  concomitant result of personal decoration and adornment. We have the
  relics of savagery which caused a man to be nicknamed from some animal.
  The conjunction of the two produces the effort to apply the opportunity
  for decoration and the vanity of the animal nickname to each other.</p>

  <p>We are fast approaching armory. In those days every man fought, and
  his weapons were the most cherished of his personal possessions. The
  sword his father fought with, the shield his father carried, the banner
  his father followed would naturally be amongst the articles a son would
  be most eager to possess. Herein are the rudiments of the idea of
  heredity in armory; and the science of armory as we know it begins to
  slowly evolve itself from that point, for the son would naturally take a
  pride in upholding the fame which had clustered round the pictured signs
  and emblems under which his father had warred.</p>

  <p>Another element then appeared which exercised a vast influence upon
  armory. Europe rang from end to end with the call to the Crusades. We may
  or we may not understand the fanaticism which gripped the whole of the
  Christian world and sent it forth to fight the Saracens. That has little
  to do with it. The result was the collection together in a comparatively
  restricted space of all that was best and noblest amongst the human race
  at that time. And the spirit of emulation caused nation to vie with
  nation, and individual with individual in the performance of illustrious
  feats of honour. War was elevated to the dignity of a sacred duty, and
  the implements of warfare rose in estimation. It is easy to understand
  the glory therefore that attached to arms, and the slow evolution which I
  have been endeavouring to indicate became a concrete fact, and it is due
  to the Crusades that the origin of armory as we now know it was
  practically coeval throughout Europe, and also that a large proportion of
  the charges and terms and rules of heraldry are identical in all European
  countries.</p>

  <p>The next dominating influence was the introduction, in the early part
  of the thirteenth century, of the closed helmet. This hid the face of the
  wearer from his followers and necessitated some means by which the latter
  could identify the man under whom they served. What more natural than
  that they should identify him by the <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="032.png"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>decoration of his shield and the ornaments
  of his helmet, and by the coat or surcoat which he wore over his coat of
  mail?</p>

  <p>This surcoat had afforded another opportunity of decoration, and it
  had been decorated with the same signs that the wearer had painted on his
  shield, hence the term "coat of arms." This textile coat was in itself a
  product of the Crusades. The Crusaders went in their metal armour from
  the cooler atmospheres of Europe to the intolerable heat of the East. The
  surcoat and the lambrequin alike protected the metal armour and the metal
  helmet from the rays of the sun and the resulting discomfort to the
  wearer, and were also found very effective as a preventative of the rust
  resulting from rain and damp upon the metal. By the time that the closed
  helmet had developed the necessity of distinction and the identification
  of a man with the pictured signs he wore or carried, the evolution of
  armory into the science we know was practically complete. <!-- Page 19

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER II</h5>

<h5>THE STATUS AND THE MEANING OF A COAT OF ARMS IN GREAT BRITAIN</h5>

  <p>It would be foolish and misleading to assert that the possession of a
  coat of arms at the present date has anything approaching the dignity
  which attached to it in the days of long ago; but one must trace this
  through the centuries which have passed in order to form a true estimate
  of it, and also to properly appreciate a coat of arms at the present
  time. It is necessary to go back to the Norman Conquest and the broad
  dividing lines of social life in order to obtain a correct knowledge. The
  Saxons had no armory, though they had a very perfect civilisation. This
  civilisation William the Conqueror upset, introducing in its place the
  system of feudal tenure with which he had been familiar on the Continent.
  Briefly, this feudal system may be described as the partition of the land
  amongst the barons, earls, and others, in return for which, according to
  the land they held, they accepted a liability of military service for
  themselves and so many followers. These barons and earls in their turn
  sublet the land on terms advantageous to themselves, but nevertheless
  requiring from those to whom they sublet the same military service which
  the King had exacted from themselves proportionate with the extent of the
  sublet lands. Other subdivisions took place, but always with the same
  liability of military service, until we come to those actually holding
  and using the lands, enjoying them subject to the liability of military
  service attached to those particular lands. Every man who held land under
  these conditions&mdash;and it was impossible to hold land without
  them&mdash;was of the upper class. He was <i>nobilis</i> or <i>known</i>,
  and of a rank distinct, apart, and absolutely separate from the remainder
  of the population, who were at one time actually serfs, and for long
  enough afterwards, of no higher social position than they had enjoyed in
  their period of servitude. This wide distinction between the upper and
  lower classes, which existed from one end of Europe to the other, was the
  very root and foundation of armory. It cannot be too greatly insisted
  upon. There were two qualitative terms, "gentle" and "simple," which were
  applied to the upper and lower classes respectively. Though now becoming
  archaic and obsolete, the terms "gentle" and "simple" <!-- Page 20
  --><span class="pagenum" title="034.png"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>are still occasionally to be met with used
  in that original sense; and the two adjectives "gentle" and "simple," in
  the everyday meanings of the words, are derived from, and are a
  <i>later</i> growth from the original usage with the meaning of the upper
  and lower classes; because the quality of being gentle was supposed to
  exist in that class of life referred to as gentle, whilst the quality of
  simplicity was supposed to be an attribute of the lower class. The word
  gentle is derived from the Latin word <i>gens (gentilis)</i>, meaning a
  man, because those were <i>men</i> who were not serfs. Serfs and slaves
  were nothing accounted of. The word "gentleman" is a <i>derivative</i> of
  the word gentle, and a gentleman was a member of the gentle or upper
  class, and gentle qualities were so termed because they were the
  qualities supposed to belong to the gentle class. A man was not a
  gentleman, even in those days, because he happened to possess personal
  qualities usually associated with the gentle class; a man was a gentleman
  if he belonged to the gentle or upper class and not otherwise, so that
  "gentleman" was an identical term for one to whom the word <i>nobilis</i>
  was applied, both being names for members of the upper class. To all
  intents and purposes at that date there was no middle class at all. The
  kingdom was the land; and the trading community who dwelt in the towns
  were of little account save as milch kine for the purposes of taxation.
  The social position conceded to them by the upper class was little, if
  any, more than was conceded to the lower classes, whose life and
  liberties were held very cheaply. Briefly to sum up, therefore, there
  were but the two classes in existence, of which the upper class were
  those who held the land, who had military obligations, and who were
  noble, or in other words gentle. Therefore all who held land were
  gentlemen; because they held land they had to lead their servants and
  followers into battle, and they themselves were personally responsible
  for the appearance of so many followers, when the King summoned them to
  war. Now we have seen in the previous chapter that arms became necessary
  to the leader that his followers might distinguish him in battle.
  Consequently all who held land having, because of that land, to be
  responsible for followers in battle, found it necessary to use arms. The
  corollary is therefore evident, that all who held lands of the King were
  gentlemen or noble, and used arms; and as a consequence all who possessed
  arms were gentlemen, for they would not need or use arms, nor was their
  armour of a character upon which they could display arms, unless they
  were leaders. The leaders, we have seen, were the land-owning or upper
  class; therefore every one who had arms was a gentleman, and every
  gentleman had arms. But the status of gentlemen existed before there were
  coats of arms, and the later inseparable connection between the two was
  an evolution.</p>

  <p>The preposterous prostitution of the word gentleman in these latter
  <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum" title="035.png"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>days is due to the almost universal
  attribute of human nature which declines to admit itself as of other than
  gentle rank; and in the eager desire to write itself gentleman, it has
  deliberately accepted and ordained a meaning to the word which it did not
  formerly possess, and has attributed to it and allowed it only such a
  definition as would enable almost anybody to be included within its
  ranks.</p>

  <p>The word gentleman nowadays has become meaningless as a word in an
  ordinary vocabulary; and to use the word with its original and true
  meaning, it is necessary to now consider it as purely a technical term.
  We are so accustomed to employ the word nowadays in its unrestricted
  usage that we are apt to overlook the fact that such a usage is
  comparatively modern. The following extract from "The Right to Bear Arms"
  will prove that its real meaning was understood and was decided by law so
  late as the seventeenth century to be "a man entitled to bear
  arms":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The following case in the Earl Marshal's Court, which hung upon the
  definition of the word, conclusively proves my contention:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'<i>21st November 1637.</i>&mdash;W. Baker, gent., humbly sheweth
  that having some occasion of conference with Adam Spencer of Broughton
  under the Bleane, co. Cant., on or about 28th July last, the said Adam
  did in most base and opprobrious tearmes abuse your petitioner, calling
  him a base, lying fellow, &amp;c. &amp;c. The defendant pleaded that
  Baker is noe Gentleman, and soe not capable of redresse in this court. Le
  Neve, Clarenceux, is directed to examine the point raised, and having
  done so, declared as touching the gentry of William Baker, that Robert
  Cooke, Clarenceux King of Arms, did make a declaration 10th May 1573,
  under his hand and seale of office, that George Baker of London, sonne of
  J. Baker of the same place, sonne of Simon Baker of Feversham, co. Cant.,
  was a bearer of tokens of honour, and did allow and confirm to the said
  George Baker and to his posterity, and to the posterity of Christopher
  Baker, these Arms, &amp;c. &amp;c. And further, Le Neve has received
  proof that the petitioner, William Baker, is the son of William Baker of
  Kingsdowne, co. Cant., who was the brother of George Baker, and son of
  Christopher aforesaid.' The judgment is not stated. (The original
  Confirmation of Arms by Cooke, 10th May 1573, may now be seen in the
  British Museum.&mdash;<i>Genealogist</i> for 1889, p. 242.)"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It has been shown that originally practically all who held land bore
  arms. It has also been shown that armory was an evolution, and as a
  consequence it did not start, in this country at any rate, as a
  ready-made science with all its rules and laws completely known or
  promulgated. There is not the slightest doubt that, in the earliest
  infancy of the science, arms were assumed and chosen without the control
  of the Crown; and one would not be far wrong in assuming that, so long as
  the rights accruing from prior appropriation of other people were
  respected, a landowner finding the necessity of arms in battle, was
  originally at liberty to assume what arms he liked.</p>

  <p>That period, however, was of but brief duration, for we find as early
  <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum" title="036.png"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>as 1390, from the celebrated Scrope and
  Grosvenor case, (1) that a man could have obtained at that time a
  definite right to his arms, (2) that this right could be enforced against
  another, and we find, what is more important, (3) that the Crown and the
  Sovereign had supreme control and jurisdiction over arms, and (4) that
  the Sovereign could and did grant arms. From that date down to the
  present time the Crown, both by its own direct action and by the action
  of the Kings of Arms to whom it delegates powers for the purpose, in
  Letters Patent under the Great Seal, specifically issued to each separate
  King of Arms upon his appointment, has continued to grant armorial
  bearings. Some number of early grants of arms direct from the Crown have
  been printed in the <i>Genealogical Magazine</i>, and some of the
  earliest distinctly recite that the recipients are made noble and created
  gentlemen, and that the arms are given them as <i>the sign of their
  nobility</i>. The class of persons to whom grants of arms were made in
  the earliest days of such instruments is much the same as the class which
  obtain grants of arms at the present day, and the successful trader or
  merchant is now at liberty, as he was in the reign of Henry VIII. and
  earlier, to raise himself to the rank of a gentleman by obtaining a grant
  of arms. A family must make its start at some time or other; let this
  start be made honestly, and not by the appropriation of the arms of some
  other man.</p>

  <p>The illegal assumption of arms began at an early date; and in spite of
  the efforts of the Crown, which have been more or less continuous and
  repeated, it has been found that the use of "other people's" arms has
  continued. In the reign of Henry V. a very stringent proclamation was
  issued on the subject; and in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and her
  successors, the Kings of Arms were commanded to make perambulations
  throughout the country for the purpose of pulling down and defacing
  improper arms, of recording arms properly borne by authority, and of
  compelling those who used arms without authority to obtain authority for
  them or discontinue their use. These perambulations were termed
  Visitations. The subject of Visitations, and in fact the whole subject of
  the right to bear arms, is dealt with at length in the book to which
  reference has been already made, namely, "The Right to Bear Arms."</p>

  <p>The glory of a descent from a long line of armigerous ancestors, the
  glory and the pride of race inseparably interwoven with the inheritance
  of a name which has been famous in history, the fact that some arms have
  been designed to commemorate heroic achievements, the fact that the
  display of a particular coat of arms has been the method, which society
  has countenanced, of advertising to the world that one is of the upper
  class or a descendant of some ancestor who performed some glorious deed
  to which the arms have reference, the fact that arms themselves are the
  very sign of a particular descent or of a particular <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum" title="037.png"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span>rank, have all tended to cause a false and
  fictitious value to be placed upon all these pictured emblems which as a
  whole they have never possessed, and which I believe they were never
  intended to possess. It is <i>because</i> they were the prerogative and
  the sign of aristocracy that they have been coveted so greatly, and
  consequently so often assumed improperly. Now aristocracy and social
  position are largely a matter of personal assertion. A man assumes and
  asserts for himself a certain position, which position is gradually and
  imperceptibly but continuously increased and elevated as its assertion is
  reiterated. There is no particular moment in a man's life at the present
  time, the era of the great middle class, at which he visibly steps from a
  plebeian to a patrician standing. And when he has fought and talked the
  world into conceding him a recognised position in the upper classes, he
  naturally tries to obliterate the fact that he or "his people" were ever
  of any other social position, and he hesitates to perpetually date his
  elevation to the rank of gentility by obtaining a grant of arms and
  thereby admitting that before that date he and his people were plebeian.
  Consequently he waits until some circumstance compels an application for
  a grant, and the consequence is that he thereby post-dates his actual
  technical gentility to a period long subsequent to the recognition by
  Society of his position in the upper classes.</p>

  <p>Arms are the sign of the technical rank of gentility. The possession
  of arms is a matter of hereditary privilege, which privilege the Crown is
  willing should be obtained upon certain terms by any who care to possess
  it, who live according to the style and custom which is usual amongst
  gentle people. And so long as the possession of arms is a matter of
  privilege, even though this privilege is no greater than is consequent
  upon payment of certain fees to the Crown and its officers; for so long
  will that privilege possess a certain prestige and value, though this may
  not be very great. Arms have never possessed any greater value than
  attaches to a matter of privilege; and (with singularly few exceptions)
  in every case, be it of a peer or baronet, of knight or of simple
  gentleman, this privilege has been obtained or has been regularised by
  the payment at some time or other of fees to the Crown and its officers.
  And the <i>only</i> difference between arms granted and paid for
  yesterday and arms granted and paid for five hundred years ago is the
  simple moral difference which attaches to the dates at which the payments
  were made.</p>

  <p>Gentility is merely hereditary rank, emanating, with all other rank,
  from the Crown, the sole fountain of honour. It is idle to make the word
  carry a host of meanings it was never intended to. Arms being the sign of
  the technical rank of gentility, the use of arms is the advertisement of
  one's claim to that gentility. Arms mean nothing more. By <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum" title="038.png"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>coronet, supporters, and helmet can be
  indicated one's place in the scale of precedence; by adding arms for your
  wife you assert that she also is of gentle rank; your quarterings show
  the other gentle families you represent; difference marks will show your
  position in your own family (not a very important matter); augmentations
  indicate the deeds of your ancestors which the Sovereign thought worthy
  of being held in especial remembrance. <i>By the use of a certain coat of
  arms, you assert your descent from the person to whom those arms were
  granted, confirmed, or allowed.</i> That is the beginning and end of
  armory. Why seek to make it mean more?</p>

  <p>However heraldry is looked upon, it must be admitted that from its
  earliest infancy armory possessed two essential qualities. It was the
  definite sign of hereditary nobility and rank, and it was practically an
  integral part of warfare; but also from its earliest infancy it formed a
  means of decoration. It would be a rash statement to assert that armory
  has lost its actual military character even now, but it certainly
  possessed it undiminished so long as tournaments took place, for the
  armory of the tournament was of a much higher standard than the armory of
  the battlefield. Armory as an actual part of warfare existed as a means
  of decoration for the implements of warfare, and as such it certainly
  continues in some slight degree to the present day.</p>

  <p>Armory in that bygone age, although it existed as the symbol of the
  lowest hereditary rank, was worn and used in warfare, for purposes of
  pageantry, for the indication of ownership, for decorative purposes, for
  the needs of authenticity in seals, and for the purposes of memorials in
  records, pedigrees, and monuments. All those uses and purposes of armory
  can be traced back to a period coeval with that to which our certain
  knowledge of the existence of armory runs. Of all those usages and
  purposes, one only, that of the use of armorial bearings in actual
  battle, can be said to have come to an end, and even that not entirely
  so; the rest are still with us in actual and extensive existence. I am
  not versed in the minutiæ of army matters or army history, but I think I
  am correct in saying that there was no such thing as a regular standing
  army or a national army until the reign of Henry VIII. Prior to that time
  the methods of the feudal system supplied the wants of the country. The
  actual troops were in the employment, not of the Crown, but of the
  individual leaders. The Sovereign called upon, and had the right to call
  upon, those leaders to provide troops; but as those troops were not in
  the direct employment of the Crown, they wore the liveries and heraldic
  devices of their leaders. The leaders wore their own devices, originally
  for decorative reasons, and later that they might be distinguished by
  their particular followers: hence the actual use in battle in former days
  of private armorial bearings. And even yet the <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="039.png"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>practice
  is not wholly extinguished, for the tartans of the Gordon and Cameron
  Highlanders are a relic of the usages of these former days. With the
  formation of a standing army, and the direct service of the troops to the
  Crown, the liveries and badges of those who had formerly been responsible
  for the troops gave way to the liveries and badges of the Crown. The
  uniform of the Beefeaters is a good example of the method in which in the
  old days a servant wore the badge and livery of his lord. The Beefeaters
  wear the scarlet livery of the Sovereign, and wear the badge of the
  Sovereign still. Many people will tell you, by the way, that the uniform
  of a Beefeater is identical now with what it was in the days of Henry
  VIII. It isn't. In accordance with the strictest laws of armory, the
  badge, embroidered on the front and back of the tunic, has changed, and
  is now the triple badge&mdash;the rose, the thistle, and the
  shamrock&mdash;of the triple kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Every
  soldier who wears a scarlet coat, the livery of his Sovereign, every
  regiment that carries its colours, every saddle-cloth with a Royal emblem
  thereupon, is evidence that the use of armory in battle still exists in a
  small degree to the present day; but circumstances have altered. The
  troops no longer attack to the cry of "A Warwick! a Warwick!" they serve
  His Majesty the King and wear his livery and devices. They no longer
  carry the banner of their officer, whose servants and tenants they would
  formerly have been; the regiment cherishes instead the banner of the
  armorial bearings of His Majesty. Within the last few years, probably
  within the lifetime of all my readers, there has been striking evidence
  of the manner in which circumstances alter everything. The Zulu War put
  an end to the practice of taking the colours of a regiment into battle;
  the South African War saw khaki substituted universally for the scarlet
  livery of His Majesty; and to have found upon a South African battlefield
  the last remnant of the armorial practices of the days of chivalry, one
  would have needed, I am afraid, to examine the buttons of the troopers.
  Still the scarlet coat exists in the army on parade: the Life Guards wear
  the Royal Cross of St. George and the Star of the Garter, the Scots Greys
  have the Royal Saltire of St. Andrew, and the Gordon Highlanders have the
  Gordon crest of the Duke of Richmond and Gordon; and there are many other
  similar instances.</p>

  <p>There is yet another point. The band of a regiment is maintained by
  the officers of the regiment, and at the present day in the Scottish
  regiments the pipers have attached to their pipes banners bearing the
  various <i>personal</i> armorial bearings of the officers of the
  regiment. So that perhaps one is justified in saying that the use of
  armorial bearings in warfare has not yet come to an end. The other
  ancient usages of armory exist now as they existed in the earliest times.
  So that it is <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum" title="040.png"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>foolish to contend that armory has ceased to
  exist, save as an interesting survival of the past. It is a living
  reality, more <i>widely</i> in use at the present day than ever
  before.</p>

  <p>Certainly the military side of armory has sunk in importance till it
  is now utterly overshadowed by the decorative, but the fact that armory
  still exists as the sign and adjunct of hereditary rank utterly forbids
  one to assert that armory is dead, and though this side of armory is also
  now partly overshadowed by its decorative use, armory must be admitted to
  be still alive whilst its laws can still be altered. When, if ever, rank
  is finally swept away, and when the Crown ceases to grant arms, and
  people cease to use them, then armory will be dead, and can be treated as
  the study of a dead science. <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum" title="041.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER III</h5>

<h5>THE HERALDS AND OFFICERS OF ARMS</h5>

  <p>The crown is the Fountain of Honour, having supreme control of
  coat-armour. This control in all civilised countries is one of the
  appanages of sovereignty, but from an early period much of the actual
  control has been delegated to the Heralds and Kings of Arms. The word
  Herald is derived from the Anglo-Saxon&mdash;<i>here</i>, an army, and
  <i>wald</i>, strength or sway&mdash;though it has probably come to us
  from the German word <i>Herold</i>.</p>

  <p>In the last years of the twelfth century there appeared at festal
  gatherings persons mostly habited in richly coloured clothing, who
  delivered invitations to the guests, and, side by side with the stewards,
  superintended the festivities. Many of them were minstrels, who, after
  tournaments or battle, extolled the deeds of the victors. These
  individuals were known in Germany as <i>Garzune</i>.</p>

  <p>Originally every powerful leader had his own herald, and the dual
  character of minstrel and messenger led the herald to recount the deeds
  of his master, and, as a natural consequence, of his master's ancestors.
  In token of their office they wore the coats of arms of the leaders they
  served; and the original status of a herald was that of a non-combatant
  messenger. When tournaments came into vogue it was natural that some one
  should examine the arms of those taking part, and from this the duties of
  the herald came to include a knowledge of coat-armour. As the Sovereign
  assumed or arrogated the control of arms, the right to grant arms, and
  the right of judgment in disputes concerning arms, it was but the natural
  result that the personal heralds of the Sovereign should be required to
  have a knowledge of the arms of his principal subjects, and should obtain
  something in the nature of a cognisance or control and jurisdiction over
  those arms; for doubtless the actions of the Sovereign would often depend
  upon the knowledge of his heralds.</p>

  <p>The process of development in this country will be more easily
  understood when it is remembered that the Marshal or Earl Marshal was in
  former times, with the Lord High Constable, the first in <i>military</i>
  rank under the King, who usually led his army in person, and to <!-- Page
  28 --><span class="pagenum" title="042.png"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>the Marshal was deputed the ordering and
  arrangement of the various bodies of troops, regiments, bands of
  retainers, &amp;c., which ordering was at first facilitated and at length
  entirely determined by the use of various pictorial ensigns, such as
  standards, banners, crests, cognisances, and badges. The due arrangement
  and knowledge of these various ensigns became first the necessary study
  and then the ordinary duty of these officers of the Marshal, and their
  possession of such knowledge, which soon in due course had to be written
  down and tabulated, secured to them an important part in mediæval life.
  The result was that at an early period we find them employed in
  semi-diplomatic missions, such as carrying on negotiations between
  contending armies on the field, bearing declarations of war, challenges
  from one sovereign to another, besides arranging the ceremonial not only
  of battles and tournaments, but also of coronations, Royal baptisms,
  marriages, and funerals.</p>

  <p>From the fact that neither King of Arms nor Herald is mentioned as
  officiating in the celebrated Scrope and Grosvenor case, of which very
  full particulars have come down to us, it is evident that the control of
  arms had not passed either in fact or in theory from the Crown to the
  officers of arms at that date. Konrad Grünenberg, in his
  <i>Wappencodex</i> ("Roll of Arms"), the date of which is 1483, gives a
  representation of a <i>helmschau</i> (literally helmet-show), here
  reproduced (Fig. 12), which includes the figure of a herald. Long before
  that date, however, the position of a herald in England was well defined,
  for we find that on January 5, 1420, the King appointed William Bruges to
  be Garter King of Arms. It is usually considered in England that it would
  be found that in Germany armory reached its highest point of evolution.
  Certainly German heraldic art is in advance of our own, and it is curious
  to read in the latest and one of the best of German heraldic books that
  "from the very earliest times heraldry was carried to a higher degree of
  perfection and thoroughness in England than elsewhere, and that it has
  maintained itself at the same level until the present day. In other
  countries, for the most part, heralds no longer have any existence but in
  name." The initial figure which appears at the commencement of Chapter I.
  represents John Smert, Garter King of Arms, and is taken from the grant
  of arms issued by him to the Tallow Chandlers' Company of London, which
  is dated September 24, 1456.</p>

  <p>Long before there was any College of Arms, the Marshal, afterwards the
  Earl Marshal, had been appointed. The Earl Marshal is now head of the
  College of Arms, and to him has been delegated the whole of the control
  both of armory and of the College, with the exception of that part which
  the Crown has retained in its own hands. <!-- Page 29 --><span

  <p>The title of King of Arms, or, as it was more anciently written, King
  of Heralds, was no doubt originally given to the chief or principal
  officer, who presided over the heralds of a kingdom, or some principal
  province, which heraldic writers formerly termed <i>marches</i>; or else
  the title was conferred upon the officer of arms attendant upon some
  particular order of knighthood. Garter King of Arms, who is immediately
  attached to that illustrious order, is likewise Principal King of Arms,
  and these, although separate and distinct offices, are and have been
  always united in one person. Upon the revival and new modelling of the
  Order of the Bath, in the reign of George the First, a King of Arms was
  created and attached to it, by the title of Bath King of Arms; and King
  George III., upon the institution of the Hanoverian Guelphic Order of
  Knighthood, annexed to that order a King of Arms, by the appellation of
  Hanover. At the time of the creation of his office, Bath King of Arms was
  given Wales as his province, the intention being that he should rank with
  the others, granting arms in his own province, but he was not, nor was
  Hanover, nor is the King of Arms of the Order of St. Michael and St.
  George, a member (as such) of the corporation of the College of Arms. The
  members of that corporation considered that the gift of the province of
  Wales, the jurisdiction over which they had previously possessed, to Bath
  King was an infringement of their chartered privileges. The dispute was
  referred to the law officers of the Crown, whose opinion was in favour of
  the corporate body.</p>

  <p>Berry in his <i>Encyclopædia Heraldica</i> further remarks: "The Kings
  of Arms of the provincial territories have the titles of
  <i>Clarenceux</i> and <i>Norroy</i>, the jurisdiction of the former
  extending over the south, east, and west parts of England, from the river
  Trent southwards; and that of the latter, the remaining part of the
  kingdom northward of that river. Kings of Arms have been likewise
  assigned other provinces over different kingdoms and dominions, and
  besides Ulster King of Arms for Ireland, and Lyon King of Arms for
  Scotland, others were nominated for particular provinces abroad, when
  united to the Crown of England, such as <i>Aquitaine</i>, <i>Anjou</i>,
  and <i>Guyenne</i>, who were perhaps at their first creation intended
  only for the services of the places whose titles they bore, when the same
  should be entirely subdued to allegiance to the Crown of England, and
  who, till that time, might have had other provinces allotted to them,
  either provisionally or temporarily, within the realm of England.</p>

  <p>There were also other Kings of Arms, denominated from the dukedoms or
  earldoms which our princes enjoyed before they came to the throne, as
  <i>Lancaster</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>, <i>Richmond</i>, and
  <i>Leicester</i>, the three first <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum" title="046.png"
  ><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>having marches, or provinces, and the
  latter a similar jurisdiction. Windsor, likewise, was a local title, but
  it is doubtful whether that officer was ever a King of Arms.
  <i>Marche</i> also assumed that appellation, from his provincial
  jurisdiction over a territory so called.</p>

  <p>But although anciently there were at different periods several Kings
  of Arms in England, only two provincial Kings of Arms have, for some
  ages, been continued in office, viz. Clarenceux and Norroy, whose
  provinces or marches are, as before observed, separated by the river
  Trent, the ancient limits of the escheaters, when there are only two in
  the kingdom, and the jurisdiction of the wardens of the forests.</p>

  <p><i>Norroy</i> is considered the most ancient title, being the only one
  in England taken from the local situation of his province, unless
  <i>Marche</i> should be derived from the same cause. The title of
  <i>Norroy</i> was anciently written <i>Norreys</i> and <i>Norreis</i>,
  King of Arms of the people residing in the north; <i>Garter</i> being
  styled <i>Roy des Anglois</i>, of the people, and not
  <i>d'Angleterre</i>, of the kingdom, the inhabitants of the north being
  called <i>Norreys</i>,<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> as
  we are informed by ancient historians.</p>

  <p>It appears that there was a King of Arms for the parts or people on
  the north of Trent as early as the reign of Edward I., from which, as Sir
  Henry Spelman observes, it may be inferred that the southern, eastern,
  and western parts had principal heralds, or Kings of Arms, although their
  titles at that early age cannot now be ascertained.</p>

  <p><i>Norroy</i> had not the title of King till after the reign of Edward
  II. It was appropriated to a King of Heralds, expressly called <i>Rex
  Norroy</i>, <i>Roy d'Armes del North</i>, <i>Rex Armorum del North</i>,
  <i>Rex de North</i>, and <i>Rex Norroy du North</i>; and the term <i>Roy
  Norreys</i> likewise occurs in the Pell Rolls of the 22nd Edward III.;
  but from that time till the 9th of Richard II. no farther mention is made
  of any such officer, from which it is probable a different person enjoyed
  the office by some other title during that interval, particularly as the
  office was actually executed by other Kings of Arms, immediately after
  that period. <i>John Otharlake, Marche King of Arms</i>, executed it in
  the 9th of Richard II., Richard del Brugg, Lancaster King of Arms, 1st
  Henry IV., and <i>Ashwell</i>, <i>Boys</i>, and <i>Tindal</i>,
  successively <i>Lancaster Kings of Arms</i>, until the end of that
  monarch's reign.</p>

  <p>Edward IV. replaced this province under a King of Arms, and revived
  the dormant title of <i>Norroy</i>. But in the Statute of Resumptions,
  <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum" title="047.png"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>made 1st Henry VII., a clause was inserted
  that the same should not extend to <i>John Moore</i>, otherwise
  <i>Norroy</i>, chief Herald King of Arms of the north parts of this realm
  of England, so appointed by King Edward IV. by his Letters Patent,
  bearing date 9th July, in the eighteenth year of his reign. It has since
  continued without interruption.</p>

  <p><i>Falcon King of Arms</i> seems the next who had the title of King
  conferred upon him, and was so named from one of the Royal badges of King
  Edward III., and it was afterwards given to a herald and pursuivant,
  under princes who bore the falcon as a badge or cognisance, and it is
  difficult to ascertain whether this officer was considered a king,
  herald, or pursuivant. <i>Froissart</i> in 1395 calls <i>Faucon</i> only
  a herald, and in 1364 mentions this officer as a King of Arms belonging
  to the King of England; but it is certain that in the 18th Richard II.
  there was a King of Arms by that appellation, and so continued until the
  reign of Richard III., if not later; but at what particular period of
  time the officer was discontinued cannot be correctly ascertained.</p>

  <p><i>Windsor</i> has been considered by some writers to have been the
  title of a King of Arms, from an abbreviation in some old records, which
  might be otherwise translated. There is, however, amongst the Protections
  in the Tower of London, one granted in the 49th Edward III. to <i>Stephen
  de Windesore, Heraldo Armorum rege dicto</i>, which seems to favour the
  conjecture, and other records might be quoted for and against this
  supposition, which might have arisen through mistake in the entries, as
  they contradict one another.</p>

  <p><i>Marche</i> seems the next in point of antiquity of creation; but
  although Sir Henry Spelman says that King Edward IV. descended from the
  <i>Earls of Marche</i>, promoted <i>Marche Herald</i> to be a King of
  Arms, giving him, perhaps, the marches for his province, it is pretty
  clearly ascertained that it was of a more early date, from the express
  mention of <i>March Rex Heraldorum</i> and <i>March Rex Heraldus</i> in
  records of the time of Richard II., though it may be possible that it was
  then only a nominal title, and did not become a real one till the reign
  of Edward IV., as mentioned by Spelman.</p>

  <p><i>Lancaster King of Arms</i> was, as the same author informs us, so
  created by Henry IV. in relation to his own descent from the Lancastrian
  family, and the county of Lancaster assigned to him as his province; but
  <i>Edmondson</i> contends "that that monarch superadded the title of
  Lancaster to that of Norroy, or King of the North, having, as it may be
  reasonably conjectured, given this province north of Trent, within which
  district Lancaster was situated, to him who had been formerly his officer
  of arms, by the title of that dukedom, and who might, according to
  custom, in some instances of former ages, retain his former title and
  surname of heraldship, styling himself <i>Lancaster Roy d'Armes del
  North</i>." <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum" title="048.png"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span></p>

  <p><i>Leicester King of Arms</i> was a title similar to that of
  <i>Lancaster</i>, and likewise a creation to the same Sovereign, Henry
  IV., who was also Earl of Leicester before he assumed the crown, and was
  given to a person who was before that time a herald. It appears that
  <i>Henry Grene</i> was <i>Leicester Herald</i>, 9th King Richard II., and
  in the 13th of the same reign is called a <i>Herald of the Duke of Guyen
  and Lancaster</i>, but prior to the coronation of Henry IV. he was
  certainly a King of Heralds, and so styled in a privy seal dated
  antecedent to that ceremony. A similar instrument of the tenth year of
  that monarch's reign also mentions <i>Henry Grene</i>, otherwise
  <i>Leicester King of Arms</i>.</p>

  <p>As it is evident that, during the reign of Henry IV., <i>Lancaster
  King of Arms</i> has under that title the province of the north, <i>Mr.
  Edmondson</i>, with good reason, supposes that the southern province, or
  part of that which is now under Clarenceux, might at that time be under
  this <i>Leicester</i>, especially as the title of <i>Clarenceux</i> was
  not in being till after the 3rd of Henry V., when, or soon after, the
  title of <i>Leicester</i> might have become extinct by the death of that
  officer; for although <i>Leicester King of Arms</i> went over into France
  with Henry V. in the third year of his reign, yet he is not mentioned in
  the constitutions made by the heralds at Roan in the year 1419-20.</p>

  <p><i>Clarenceux</i>, the next King of Arms in point of creation, is a
  title generally supposed to have been taken from <i>Clare</i>, in
  Suffolk, the castle at that place being the principal residence of the
  ancient Earls of Hereford, who were, from thence, though very improperly,
  called <i>Earls of Clare</i>, in the same manner as the Earls of Pembroke
  were often named <i>Earls of Strigoil and Chepstow</i>; the Earl of
  Hampshire, <i>Earl of Winchester</i>; the Earl of Derby, <i>Earl of
  Tuttebury</i>; the Earl of Sussex, <i>Earl of Chichester</i>, &amp;c.
  King Edward III. created his third son Lionel <i>Duke of Clarence</i>,
  instead of the monosyllable <i>Clare</i> (from his marriage with the
  grand-daughter of the late Earl), but Lionel dying without issue male,
  Henry IV. created his younger son Thomas <i>Duke of Clarence</i>, who
  being slain without issue 9th of Henry V., the honour remained in the
  Crown, until King Edward IV. conferred it upon his own brother. Mr.
  Sandford tells us that <i>Clarence</i> is the country about the town,
  castle, and honour of <i>Clare</i>, from which duchy the name of
  <i>Clarenceux King of Arms</i> is derived. Spelman, however, contends
  that it is a mistake in attributing the institution of <i>Clarenceux</i>
  to King Edward IV. after the honour of <i>Clarence</i> devolved as an
  escheat to the Crown upon the untimely death of his brother George, as he
  found William Horsely called by this title in the reign of Henry V. and
  also Roger Lygh, under King Henry VI.; and it is conjectured that the
  office of <i>Clarenceux King of Arms</i> is not more ancient than the
  reign of Edward III.</p>

  <p><i>Gloucester Herald</i>, frequently mentioned by historians, was
  originally <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum" title="049.png"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span>the herald of the great Humphry, Duke of
  Gloucester, of whom mention is made upon record in the 10th of Henry VI.;
  and Richard, brother to Edward IV., who was created Duke of Gloucester,
  is said to have had a herald by that title during the reign of his
  brother, and who was attendant as such at the funeral of that monarch. In
  a manuscript in the Ashmolean collection, it is stated that Richard
  Champnay attended as Gloucester King of Arms at the coronation of Richard
  III. upon the 7th July following his usurpation of the crown; but it
  appears by more authentic record that this Richard Champnay was, by the
  style and title of Herald of Arms, on the 18th September, in the first
  year of his usurpation, by patent created a King of Arms and Principal
  Herald of the parts of Wales, by the style and title of Gloucester,
  giving him licence and authority to execute all and singular that by law
  or custom in former times belonged to the office of King of Arms. It is
  supposed that the office ceased upon his death, which in all probability
  took place before that of the usurper.</p>

  <p><i>Richmond King of Arms.</i>&mdash;A herald called <i>Richmond</i> is
  frequently mentioned, as well belonging to the Crown as of the nobility.
  But the records of the reign of King Henry VII., who had before his
  elevation to the throne been Earl of Richmond, contain many entries of
  <i>Richmond King of Arms</i>; but although somewhat vague in the
  description, sufficiently bear out the conjecture that Henry VII.,
  previous to his coronation, created a new King of Arms by the title of
  <i>Richmond</i>, although no regular patent of creation has ever been
  found.</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Spelman informs us that, in addition to the two Kings of
  Arms for the two Heraldic provinces bounded north and south by the river
  Trent, there were also two provincial kings for the dominions of our
  Sovereign in France, styled <i>Guyenne</i> and <i>Agincourt</i> (omitting
  <i>Aquitaine</i> and <i>Anjou</i>, which were certainly in being at the
  same time), and another for <i>Ireland</i> by that name, altered by King
  Edward VI. into <i>Ulster</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ireland King of Arms</i> first occurs upon record 6th Richard II.,
  anno 1482, mentioned by <i>Froissart</i>, where he is called <i>Chandos
  le Roy d'Ireland</i>. A regular succession of officers, by the title of
  Ireland King of Arms, continued from that time till the reign of King
  Edward IV., but from the death of that monarch till the creation of
  Ulster by Edward VI. it is uncertain whether the title existed, or what
  became of the office.</p>

  <p>Edward VI. altered the title of Ireland King of Arms into that of
  Ulster, or rather considered it as a new institution, from the words of
  his journal: "Feb. 2. There was a King of Arms made for Ireland, whose
  name was <i>Ulster</i>, and his province was all Ireland; and he was the
  fourth King of Arms, and the first Herald of Ireland." The patent passed
  under the Great Seal of England.</p>

  <p>Guyenne, a part of Aquitaine, in France, a province belonging to <!--
  Page 34 --><span class="pagenum" title="050.png"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span>the British Crown, gave title not only to a
  King of Arms, but to a herald likewise, and Sir Henry Spelman dates its
  creation in the time of Edward I., although it is somewhat doubtful, and
  thought to be in the reign of Edward III. Guyenne Herald appears upon
  record during the reign of Henry VI., and though Kings of Arms were
  frequently styled heralds in old records, it is more than probable both
  offices were in existence at the same time. From the time of Edward IV.
  no such officers belonging to the Crown of England seem to have been
  continued, and it is doubtful whether they ever held in constant
  succession from their first creation.</p>

  <p><i>Aquitaine</i>, which included what were afterwards called Guyenne,
  Xantoigne, Gascoigne, and some islands, gave title to a King of Heralds
  as early as the reign of Edward III., and it is conjectured to have been
  an officer belonging to the Black Prince, who had the principality of
  Aquitaine given to him by his father; but although this officer is
  mentioned in the reign of Richard II. and 3rd of Henry V., no record
  occurs after the latter period.</p>

  <p><i>Agincourt</i> was also a title conferred upon a herald, in memory
  of that signal victory; and lands were granted to him for life, 6th Henry
  V., as mentioned by Sir Henry Spelman; but whether the office was
  continued, or any particular province assigned to this officer, cannot be
  ascertained.</p>

  <p><i>Anjou King of Arms</i> was likewise an officer of King Henry VI.,
  and attendant upon John, Duke of Bedford, when Regent of France, who
  assumed the title of Duke of Anjou. But upon the death of the Duke of
  Bedford, this officer was promoted to Lancaster King of Arms; and in all
  probability the title of Anjou, as a King of Heralds, was
  discontinued.</p>

  <p><i>Volant</i> also occurs upon record in the 28th Edward III., and
  <i>Vaillant</i>, <i>le Roy Vaillant Heraud</i>, and <i>le Roy
  Vailland</i>, are likewise mentioned in 1395.</p>

  <p>Henry V. instituted the office of Garter King of Arms; but at what
  particular period is rather uncertain, although Mr. Anstis has clearly
  proved that it must have taken place after the 22nd May, and before the
  3rd September, in the year 1417.</p>

  <p>Stephen Martin Leake, Esq., who filled the office, sums up its duties
  in the following words: "<i>Garter</i> was instituted by King Henry V.,
  <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1417, for the service of the Most Noble
  Order of the Garter, which was made sovereign within the office of arms
  over all other officers, subject to the Crown of England, by the name of
  Garter King of Arms of England. In this patent he is styled Principal
  King of English Arms, and Principal Officer of Arms of the Most Noble
  Order of the Garter, and has power to execute the said office by himself
  or deputy, being an herald. By the constitution of his office, he must be
  a native of <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum" title="051.png"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>England, and a gentleman bearing arms. To
  him belongs the correction of arms, and all ensigns of honour, usurped or
  borne unjustly, and also to grant arms to deserving persons, and
  supporters to the nobility and Knights of the Bath; to go next before the
  sword in solemn proceeding, none interposing, except the constable and
  marshal; to administer the oath to all the officers of arms; to have a
  habit like the registrar of the order; baron's service in the court;
  lodgings in Windsor Castle; to bear his white rod with a banner of the
  ensigns of the order thereon before the Sovereign; also when any lord
  shall enter the Parliament chamber, to assign him his place, according to
  his dignity and degree; to carry the ensign of the order to foreign
  princes, and to do, or procure to be done, what the Sovereign shall
  enjoin, relating to the order; with other duties incident to his office
  of principal King of Arms, for the execution whereof he hath a salary of
  one hundred pounds a year, payable at the Exchequer, and an hundred
  pounds more out of the revenue of the order, besides fees."</p>

  <p><i>Bath King of Arms</i> was created 11th George I., in conformity
  with the statutes established by His Majesty for the government of the
  Order of the Bath, and in obedience to those statutes was nominated and
  created by the Great Master of the Order denominated <i>Bath</i>, and in
  Latin, <i>Rex armorum Honoratissimi Ordinis Militaris de Balneo</i>.
  These statutes direct that this officer shall, in all the ceremonies of
  the order, be habited in a white mantle lined with red, having on the
  right shoulder the badge of the order, and under it a surcoat of white
  silk, lined and edged with red; that he shall wear on his breast, hanging
  to a golden chain about his neck, an escocheon of gold, enamelled with
  the arms of the order, impaling the arms of the Sovereign, crowned with
  the Imperial crown. That at all coronations he shall precede the
  companions of the order, and shall carry and wear his crown as other
  Kings of Arms are obliged to do. That the chain, escocheon, rod, and
  crown, shall be of the like materials, value, and weight, with those
  borne and used by Garter Principal King of Arms, and of the like fashion,
  the before specified variations only excepted: and that besides the
  duties required of him in the several other articles of the statutes, he
  shall diligently perform whatever the Sovereign or Great Master shall
  further command. On the 14th January 1725, His Majesty was further
  pleased by his Royal sign-manual, to erect, make, constitute, and ordain
  the then Bath King of Arms, <i>Gloucester</i> King of Arms, and principal
  Herald of the parts of Wales, and to direct letters patent to be made out
  and pass the Great Seal, empowering him to grant arms and crests to
  persons residing within the dominions of Wales, either jointly with
  Garter, or singly by himself, with the consent and at the pleasure of the
  Earl Marshal, or his deputy for the time being, and for <!-- Page 36
  --><span class="pagenum" title="052.png"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>the future that the office of Gloucester
  should be inseparably annexed, united, and perpetually consolidated with
  the office of <i>Bath King of Arms, of the Most Honourable Military Order
  of the Bath, and Gloucester King of Arms, and principal Herald of the
  parts of Wales</i>. And also that he, for the dignity of the order,
  should in all assemblies and at all times have and take place and
  precedency above and before all other provincial Kings of Arms
  whatsoever."</p>

  <p>This armorial jurisdiction, however, was subsequently, as has been
  previously explained, annulled.</p>

  <p>Concerning the heralds Berry remarks: "In former ages, when honour and
  chivalry were at their height, these officers were held in great
  estimation, as appears by the ceremonies which attended their creations,
  which was by the Sovereign himself or by special commission from him,
  and, according to Gerard Leigh, was after the following manner: The King
  asked the person to be so created whether he were a gentleman of blood or
  of second coat-armour; if he was not, the King gave him lands and fees,
  and assigned him and his heirs proper arms. Then, as the messenger was
  brought in by the herald of the province, so the pursuivant was brought
  in by the eldest herald, who, at the prince's command, performed all the
  ceremonies, as turning the coat of arms, setting the manacles thereof on
  the arms of the pursuivant, and putting about his neck the collar of SS,
  and when he was named, the prince himself took the cup from the herald,
  which was gilt, and poured the water and wine upon the head of the
  pursuivant, creating him by the name of <i>our herald</i>, and the King,
  when the oath was administered, gave the same cup to the new herald.</p>

  <p><i>Upton</i> sums up the business of a herald thus: That it was their
  office to create under officers, to number the people, to commence
  treaties of matrimony and of peace between princes, to visit kingdoms and
  regions, and to be present at martial exploits, &amp;c., and they were to
  wear a coat of their master's arms, wearing the same in conflicts and
  tournaments, in riding through foreign countries, and at all great
  entertainments, coronations of kings and queens, and the solemnities of
  princes, dukes, and other great lords.</p>

  <p>In the time of King Richard II. there belonged to the King of Arms and
  heralds the following fees, viz.: at the coronation of the King, a bounty
  of £100; when the King first displayed his banners, 100 marks; when the
  King's son was made a knight, 40 marks; when the prince and a duke first
  display their banners, £20; if it be a marquis, 20 marks; if an earl,
  £10; if a baron, 5 marks of silver crowns, of 15 nobles; and if a knight
  bachelor, newly made a banneret, 3 marks, or 10 nobles; when the King is
  married, the said Kings of Arms and heralds to have £50; when the Queen
  has a child <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum" title="053.png"><a
  name="page37"></a>{37}</span>christened, a largess at the Queen's
  pleasure, or of the lords of the council, which was sometimes £100, and
  at others 100 marks, more or less; and when she is churched, such another
  largess; when princesses, duchesses, marchionesses, countesses, and
  baronesses have a child christened, and when they are churched, a largess
  suitable to their quality and pleasure; as often as the King wears his
  crown, or holds Royal state, especially at the four great festivals of
  Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, and All Saints, to every one of the three
  Kings of Arms present when the King goes to the chapel to mass, a largess
  at the King's pleasure; when a maiden princess, or daughter of a duke,
  marquis, earl, or baron is married, there belongs to the said Kings of
  Arms, if present, the upper garment she is married in; if there be a
  combat within lists, there belong to the Kings of Arms, if present, and
  if not to the other heralds present, their pavilions; and if one of the
  combatants is vanquished, the Kings of Arms and heralds who are present
  shall have all the accoutrements of the person so vanquished, and all
  other armour that falls to the ground; when subjects rebel, and fortify
  any camp or place, and afterwards quit the same, and fly, without a
  battle, there appertain to the said Kings of Arms and heralds who are
  present all the carts, carriages, and tools left behind; and, at New
  Year's Tide, all the noblemen and knights of the court used to give the
  heralds New Year's gifts. Besides the King's heralds, in former times,
  divers noblemen had heralds and pursuivants, who went with their lords,
  with the King's heralds, when attending the King.</p>

  <p>The fees of the King's heralds and pursuivants of arms have since
  varied, and, besides fees upon creations of peers, baronets, and knights,
  they have still donations for attendance at court upon the festivals of
  Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, All Saints, and St. George's Day; fees
  upon installation of Knights of the Garter and Bath, Royal marriages,
  funerals, public solemnities, &amp;c., with small salaries paid from the
  Exchequer; but their ancient fees from the nobility, upon certain
  occasions, have been long discontinued, and their principal emolument
  arises from grants of arms, the tracing of genealogies, and recording the
  same in the Registers of the College of Arms."</p>

  <p>The present <i>heralds</i> are six in number, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Windsor Herald</i>, which title was instituted 38th of Edward III.,
  when that monarch was in France.</p>

  <p><i>Chester Herald</i>, instituted in the same reign.</p>

  <p><i>Richmond Herald</i>, instituted by King Edward IV.</p>

  <p><i>Somerset Herald</i>, instituted by King Henry VIII. about the time
  when that monarch created his son Henry Fitzroy Duke of Somerset.</p>

  <p><i>York Herald</i>, instituted by King Edward III. in honour of his
  son, whom he created Duke of York. <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum" title="054.png"
  ><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span></p>

  <p><i>Lancaster Herald</i>, also instituted by Edward III. when he
  created his son Duke of Lancaster.</p>

  <p>The heralds were first incorporated as a college by Richard III. They
  were styled the Corporation of Kings, Heralds, and Pursuivants of
  Arms.</p>

  <p>Concerning Pursuivants of Arms, Berry remarks that these officers, who
  are the lowest in degree amongst officers of arms, "were, as the name
  implies, followers, marshals, or messengers attendant upon the heralds.
  Pursuivants were formerly created by the nobility (who had, likewise,
  heralds of arms) with great ceremony in the following manner. One of the
  heralds, wearing his master's coat, leading the person to be created
  pursuivant by the left hand, and holding a cup full of wine and water in
  his right, came into the presence of the lord and master of him who was
  to be created, and of whom the herald asked by what name he would have
  his pursuivant called, which the lord having mentioned, the herald then
  poured part of the wine and water upon his head, calling him by the name
  so assigned to him. The herald then took the coat of his lord, and put it
  over his head athwart, so that part of the coat made for the arms before
  and behind, and the longer part of it on both sides of the arms of the
  person created, and in which way the pursuivant was always to wear it.
  This done, an oath of fidelity was administered to the new-made
  pursuivant, and the ceremony concluded."</p>

  <p>This curious method of the wearing of the tabard by a pursuivant has
  long since been discontinued, if indeed it was ever generally adopted, a
  point on which I have by no means been able to satisfy myself.</p>

  <p>The appointment of heralds and pursuivants of arms by the nobility has
  long been discontinued, and there are now only four pursuivants belonging
  to the College of Arms, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Rouge-Croix</i>, the first in point of antiquity of creation, is so
  styled from the red cross of St. George, the Patron Saint of England.</p>

  <p><i>Blue-Mantle</i>, so called by King Edward III., in honour of the
  French coat which he assumed, being blue.</p>

  <p><i>Rouge-Dragon</i>, so styled from the red dragon, one of the
  supporters of the Royal arms of King Henry VII. (who created this
  pursuivant), and also the badge of Wales, and</p>

  <p><i>Portcullis</i>, also instituted by Henry VII., and so named from
  that badge, or cognisance, used by him.</p>

  <p>The duties of a pursuivant are similar to those of a herald; he
  assists in all public processions, or ceremonies, such as Royal
  marriages, funerals, installations, &amp;c., and has certain fees for
  attendance upon such occasions. Pursuivants likewise receive fees upon
  creations of peers, baronets, and knights, and also donations for
  attending court upon the principal festivals of Christmas, Easter,
  Whit-Sunday, All <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum" title="057.png"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>Saints, and St. George's Day, and a small
  salary payable out of the Exchequer. They wear a tabard of damask silk,
  embroidered with the Royal arms, like the heralds, but no collar of
  SS.</p>

    Tournament Roll of Henry VIII., now preserved in the College of
    Arms.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Of the Heraldic Executive in Scotland, Lyon King of Arms (Sir James
  Balfour Paul), in his book "Heraldry in relation to Scottish History and
  Art," writes: "At one period the Lyon was solemnly crowned at his
  inauguration, and vested with his tabard and baton of office." The
  ceremony was a very elaborate one, and is fully described by Sir James
  Balfour in a MS., now in the Advocates' Library. There is also an account
  of the coronation of Sir Alexander Durham, when Laurie, the minister of
  the Tron Kirk, preached from the text, "What shall be done to the man
  whom the king delighteth to honour?" The crown was of gold, and exactly
  similar to the Imperial crown of Scotland, save that it had no jewels.
  Now the Lyon's crown is the same as the English King of Arms. The crown
  is only worn at Royal coronations. At that of Charles I. at Edinburgh in
  1633, the Lyon carried the vessel containing the sacred oil. In addition
  to his strictly armorial appointment, the Lyon is also a King of Arms of
  the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle.</p>

  <p>Heralds and pursuivants formed an important part from very early times
  not only of the Royal Household, but also of those of the higher
  nobility, many of whom had private heralds. Of these officers there is a
  very full list given by Dr. Dickson in the preface to the Lord
  Treasurer's Accounts. Of heralds who were or ultimately became part of
  the King's Household we meet with Rothesay, Marchmont, Snowdon, Albany,
  Ross, and Islay; Ireland, Orkney, and Carrick are also mentioned as
  heralds, but it is doubtful whether the first and last were ever more
  than pursuivants. Of the latter class of officers the following were in
  the Royal establishment: Carrick, Bute, Dingwall, Kintyre, Ormonde,
  Unicorn; but we also find Aliszai or Alishay, Dragance, Diligens,
  Montrose, Falkland, Ireland, Darnaway, Garioch, Ettrick, Hales, Lindsay,
  Endure, Douglas, and Angus. Of the latter Garioch was created by James
  IV. for his brother John, Earl of Mar; Hailes in 1488, when Lord Hailes
  was made Earl of Bothwell; while Lindsay and Endure were both evidently
  attached to the Lindsay family, as were Douglas and Angus to the noblemen
  whose titles they bore. In 1403 Henry IV. of England granted a pursuivant
  under the title of Shrewsbury to George, Earl of March, for services
  rendered at the battle of that name, but we do not find that the office
  was continued.</p>

  <p>In Scotland heralds appear at an early date, though none are mentioned
  as attending the coronation of Alexander III. in 1249; nor is there any
  account of any such officers accompanying that sovereign when he did
  homage to Edward I. at Westminster in 1278. In the next <!-- Page 40
  --><span class="pagenum" title="058.png"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>century, however, armorial bearings were
  quite well known in Scotland, and there is an entry in the Exchequer
  Rolls on 10th October 1337 of a payment of £32, 6s. Scots for the making
  of seventeen armorial banners, and in 1364 there is another to the
  heralds for services at the tournaments; while William Petilloch, herald,
  has a grant from David II. of three husbandlands in Bonjedward, and Allan
  Fawside gets a gift of the forfeited estate of one Coupland, a herald
  (<i>temp.</i> Edward Baliol).<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The first mention of a herald, under his
  official designation, which I have met with in our records occurs in
  1365, when there is a confirmation under the Great Seal by David II. of a
  charter by Dugal M&lsquo;Dowille to John Trupour or Trumpour "<i>nunc
  dicto Carric heraldo</i>." Sir James Balfour tells us that the Lyon and
  his heralds attended the coronation of Robert II. at Holyrood on 23rd May
  1371, but whether or not this is true&mdash;and I have not been able to
  verify it&mdash;it is certain that a Lyon Herald existed very shortly
  after that date, as in the Exchequer Rolls mention is made of the payment
  of a certain sum to such an officer in 1377; in 1379 Froissart says that
  a herald was sent by Robert II. to London to explain that the truce had
  been infringed without his will and against his knowledge, and on 8th
  April 1381 a warrant was issued in London for a licence to "Lion Heraud"
  of the King of Scots, authorising him to take away a complete suit of
  armour which he had bought in that city. It is not, however, till 1388
  that we find Lyon accorded the Royal style. In that year a payment is
  made "<i>Leoni regi heraldorum</i>," but at the audit following the
  battle of Otterburn he is called <i>defunctus</i>, which suggests that he
  had been slain on that well-fought field. The Lyon appears in several
  embassies about this period both to England and France, and one Henry
  Greve, designed in the English Issue Rolls as "King of Scottish Heralds,"
  was at the Tower of London in 1399, either at or immediately after the
  coronation of Henry IV. From 1391 onwards there is frequent mention of
  one Douglas, "Herald of the King," and in 1421 he is styled "Lyon
  Herald."</p>

  <p>Of the German officers of arms they, like the English, are divided
  into three classes, known as <i>Wappenkönige</i>, <i>Herolde</i>, and
  <i>Persevanten</i>. These, like our own officers, had peculiar titles;
  for example <i>Suchenwirt</i> (an Austrian ducal herald), <i>Lub-den
  Frumen</i> (a Lichtenstein pursuivant), <i>Jerusalem</i> (a herald of the
  Limmer Palatinate), <i>Romreich</i> (an Imperial herald). About the
  middle of the sixteenth century, the official names of the heralds fell
  into disuse; they began to make use of their ancestral names with the
  title of <i>Edel</i> and <i>Ehrenvest</i> (noble and honourable), but
  this did not last long, and the heralds found themselves thrown back <!--

  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>into the old ways, into which the knightly
  accoutrements had already wandered.</p>

    Oxford.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The official dress of an officer of arms as such in Great Britain is
  merely his tabard (Figs. 13, 14, 15). This garment in style and shape has
  remained unchanged in this country from the earliest known period of
  which representations of officers of arms exist; but whilst the tabard
  itself has remained unaltered in its style, the arms thereupon have
  constantly changed, these always being the arms of the Sovereign for the
  time being. The costume worn with the tabard has naturally been subject
  to many changes, but it is doubtful if any attempt to regulate such
  costume was ever officially made prior to the reign of Queen Victoria.
  The tabard of a pursuivant is of damask silk; that of a herald, of satin;
  and that of a king of arms, of velvet.</p>

  <p>The initial letter on page <a href="#page1">1</a> is a portrait of
  John Smert, Garter King of Arms, and is taken from the grant of arms to
  the Tallow Chandlers' Company, dated 24th September 1456. He is there
  represented as wearing beneath his tabard black breeches and coat, and a
  golden crown. But Fig. 15 is actually a representation of the first
  Garter King of Arms, William Bruges, appointed 5th January 1420. He is
  represented as carrying a white staff, a practice which has been recently
  revived, white wands being carried by all the heralds at the public
  funeral of the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone. In Germany the wands of the
  heralds were later painted with the colours of the escutcheons of the
  Sovereign to whom they were attached. There was until recently no
  official hat for an officer of arms in England, and confirmation of this
  is to be found in the fact that Dallaway mentions a special licence to
  Wriothesley Garter giving him permission to wear a cap on account of his
  great age. Obviously, however, a tabard requires other clothing to be
  worn with it. The heralds in Scotland, until quite recently, when making
  public proclamations were content to appear in the ordinary elastic-side
  boots and cloth trousers of everyday life. This gave way for a brief
  period, in which Court dress was worn below the tabard, but now, as in
  England, the recognised uniform of a member of the Royal Household is
  worn. In England, owing to the less frequent ceremonial appearances of
  the heralds, and the more scrupulous control <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="062.png"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>which has
  been exercised, no such anachronisms as were perpetuated in Scotland have
  been tolerated, and it has been customary for the officers of arms to
  wear their uniform as members of the Sovereign's Household (in which
  uniform they attend the levees) beneath the tabard when making
  proclamations at the opening of Parliament or on similar occasions. At a
  coronation and at some other full State ceremonies they wear
  knee-breeches. At the late ceremony of the coronation of King Edward
  VII., a head-dress was designed for the officers of arms. These caps are
  of black velvet embroidered at the <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum" title="063.png"
  ><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>side with a rose, a thistle, or a harp,
  respectively for the English, Scottish, and Irish officers of arms.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A great deal of confusion has arisen between the costume and the
  functions of a Herald and a Trumpeter, though the confusion has been
  confined to the minds of the uninitiated and the theatrical stage. The
  whole subject was very amusingly dealt with in the <i>Genealogical
  Magazine</i> in an article by Mr. G. Ambrose Lee, Bluemantle, and the
  illustrations which he gives of the relative dresses of the Heralds and
  the Trumpeters at different periods (see Figs. 16-19) are interesting.
  Briefly, the matter can be summed up in the statement that there never
  was a Trumpeter who made a proclamation, or wore a tabard, and there
  never was a Herald who blew a trumpet. The Trumpeters nearly <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum" title="064.png"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>always accompanied the Heralds to proclaim
  their presence and call attention to their proclamation.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In France the Heralds were formed into an incorporation by Charles VI.
  in 1406, their head being Mountjoye, King of Arms, with ten heralds and
  pursuivants under him. It will be noticed that this incorporation is
  earlier than that of the College of Arms in England. The Revolution
  played havoc with the French Records, and no College of Arms now exists
  in France. But it is doubtful whether at any time it reached the dignity
  or authority which its English counterpart has enjoyed in former
  times.</p>

  <p>Fig. 20 represents a French Herald of the early part of the fifteenth
  century. It is taken from a representation of the Rally of the Parisians
  against King Charles VI. in 1413, to be found in a MS. edition of
  Froissart, formerly in the Royal Library at Paris.</p>

  <p>All the heralds and Kings of Arms (but not the pursuivants) wear the
  curious collar of SS about which there has been so much discussion. <!--
  Page 45 --><span class="pagenum" title="065.png"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span>The form has remained unchanged, save that
  the badge is the badge for the time being of the Sovereign. The heralds
  have their collars of SS of silver, whilst those of a King of Arms are of
  silver gilt, and the latter have the further distinction that a
  portcullis is introduced on each shoulder. The heralds and Kings of Arms
  usually place these collars round their shields in representations of
  their arms. Collars of SS are also worn by Serjeants-at-Arms, and by the
  Lord Chief Justice.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:46%;">

    Crimean War.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The English Heralds have no equivalent badge to that which the
  Scottish Heralds wear suspended from their necks by a ribbon. In Ireland
  both Heralds and Pursuivants wear a badge.</p>

  <p>In addition each King of Arms has his crown; the only occasion,
  however, upon which this is worn being at the ceremony of a coronation.
  The crown is of silver gilt, formed of a circle upon which is inscribed
  part of the first verse of the 51st Psalm, viz. "Miserere mei Deus
  secundum magnam misericordiam tuam": the rim is surmounted of sixteen
  leaves, in shape resembling the oak-leaf, every alternate one being
  somewhat higher than the remainder. Nine of these leaves are shown in a
  representation of it. The cap is of crimson satin, closed at the top by a
  gold tassel, and turned up with ermine.</p>

  <p>Garter King of Arms has a baton or "sceptre" of silver gilt, about two
  feet in length, the top being of gold, of four sides of equal height,
  <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum" title="066.png"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>but of unequal breadth. On the two larger
  sides are the arms of St. George impaling the Sovereign's, and on the two
  lesser sides the arms of St. George surrounded by the Garter and motto,
  the whole ensigned with an Imperial crown. This "sceptre" has sometimes
  been placed in bend behind the arms of Garter King. Lyon King of Arms has
  a baton of blue enamel with gold extremities, the baton being powdered
  with roses, thistles, and fleurs-de-lis. Lyon (Sir James Balfour Paul) in
  his "Heraldry in relation to Scottish History and Art," remarks that this
  is one of the few pieces of British official regalia which is still
  adorned with the ancient ensigns of France. But knowing how strictly all
  official regalia in England is required to have the armorial devices
  thereupon changed, as the Royal arms and badges change, there can be very
  little doubt that the appearance of the fleur-de-lis in this case is due
  to an oversight. The baton happens to be that of a former Lyon King of
  Arms, which really should long since have been discarded and a new one
  substituted. Two batons are usually placed in saltire behind the arms of
  Lyon King of Arms.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Ulster King of Arms has a staff of office which, however, really
  belongs to his office as Knight Attendant on the Most Illustrious Order
  of St. Patrick.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Heralds each have a rod of ebony tipped with ivory, <!--
  Page 47 --><span class="pagenum" title="067.png"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span>which has been sometimes stated to be a rod
  of office. This, however, is not the case, and the explanation of their
  possession of it is very simple. They are constantly called upon by
  virtue of their office to make from the Market Cross in Edinburgh the
  Royal Proclamations. Now these Proclamations are read from printed copies
  which in size of type and paper are always of the nature of a poster. The
  Herald would naturally find some difficulty in holding up a large piece
  of paper of this size on a windy day, in such a manner that it was easy
  to read from; consequently he winds it round his ebony staff, slowly
  unwinding it all the time as he reads.</p>

  <p>Garter King of Arms, Lyon King of Arms, and Ulster King of Arms all
  possess badges of their offices which they wear about their necks.</p>

  <p>The badge of Garter is of gold, having on both sides the arms of St.
  George, impaled with those of the Sovereign, within the Garter and motto,
  enamelled in their proper colours, and ensigned with the Royal crown.</p>

  <p>The badge of Lyon King of Arms is oval, and is worn suspended by a
  broad green ribbon. The badge proper consists on the obverse of the
  effigy of St. Andrew bearing his cross before him, with a thistle
  beneath, all enamelled in the proper colours on an azure ground. The
  reverse contains the arms of Scotland, having in the lower parts of the
  badge a thistle, as on the other side; the whole surmounted with the
  Imperial crown.</p>

  <p>The badge of "Ulster" is of gold, containing on one side the cross of
  St. Patrick, or, as it is described in the statutes, "The cross gules of
  the Order upon a field argent, impaled with the arms of the Realm of
  Ireland," and both encircled with the motto, "Quis Separabit," and the
  date of the institution of the Order, <span
  class="sm">MDCCLXXXIII</span>. The reverse exhibits the arms of the
  office of Ulster, viz.: "Or, a cross gules, on a chief of the last a lion
  of England between a harp and portcullis, all of the first," placed on a
  ground of green enamel, surrounded by a gold border with shamrocks,
  surmounted by an Imperial crown, and suspended by a sky-blue riband from
  the neck.</p>

  <p>The arms of the Corporation of the College of Arms are: Argent, a
  cross gules between four doves, the dexter wing of each expanded and
  inverted azure. Crest: on a ducal coronet or, a dove rising azure.
  Supporters: two lions rampant guardant argent, ducally gorged or.</p>

  <p>The official arms of the English Kings of Arms are:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Garter King of Arms.</i>&mdash;Argent, a cross gules, on a chief
  azure, a ducal coronet encircled with a garter, between a lion passant
  guardant on the dexter and a fleur-de-lis on the sinister all or.</p>

  <p><i>Clarenceux King of Arms.</i>&mdash;Argent, a cross gules, on a
  chief of the second a lion passant guardant or, crowned of the last. <!--
  Page 48 --><span class="pagenum" title="068.png"><a

  <p><i>Norroy King of Arms.</i>&mdash;Argent, a cross gules, on a chief of
  the second a lion passant guardant crowned of the first, between a
  fleur-de-lis on the dexter and a key on the sinister of the last.</p>

  <p>Badges have never been officially assigned to the various Heralds by
  any specific instruments of grant or record; but from a remote period
  certain of the Royal badges relating to their titles have been used by
  various Heralds, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lancaster.</i>&mdash;The red rose of Lancaster ensigned by the
  Royal crown.</p>

  <p><i>York.</i>&mdash;The white rose of York en soleil ensigned by the
  Royal crown.</p>

  <p><i>Richmond.</i>&mdash;The red rose of Lancaster impaled with the
  white rose en soleil of York, the whole ensigned with the Royal
  crown.</p>

  <p><i>Windsor.</i>&mdash;Rays of the sun issuing from clouds.</p>

  <p>The four Pursuivants make use of the badges from which they derive
  their titles.</p>

  <p>The official arms of Lyon King of Arms and of Lyon Office are the
  same, namely: Argent, a lion sejant full-faced gules, holding in the
  dexter paw a thistle slipped vert and in the sinister a shield of the
  second; on a chief azure, a St. Andrew's cross of the field.</p>

  <p>There are no official arms for Ulster's Office, that office, unlike
  the College of Arms, not being a corporate body, but the official arms of
  Ulster King of Arms are: Or, a cross gules, on a chief of the last a lion
  passant guardant between a harp and a portcullis all of the field. <!--

  <p>Monumental brasses do not merely afford a guide to the capricious
  changes of fashion in armour, in ecclesiastical vestments (which have
  altered but little), and in legal, civilian, and feminine costume, but
  they provide us also with a vast number of admirable specimens of
  heraldic art. The vandal and the fanatic have robbed us of many of these
  beautiful memorials, but of those which survive to our own day the
  earliest on the continent of Europe marks the last resting-place of Abbot
  Ysowilpe, 1231, at Verden, in Hanover. In England there was once a brass,
  which unfortunately disappeared long ago, to an Earl of Bedford, in St.
  Paul's Church, Bedford, of the year 1208, leaving 1277 as the date of the
  earliest one.</p>

  <p>Latten (Fr. <i>laiton</i>), the material of which brasses were made,
  was at an early date manufactured in large quantities at Cologne, whence
  plates of this metal came to be known as cullen (Köln) plates; these were
  largely exported to other countries, and the Flemish workmen soon
  attained the greatest proficiency in their engraving. Flemish brasses are
  usually large and rectangular, having the space between the figure and
  the marginal inscription filled either by diaper work or by small figures
  in niches. Brasses vary considerably in size: the matrix of Bishop
  Beaumont's brass in Durham Cathedral measures about 16 feet by 8 feet,
  and the memorial to Griel van Ruwescuere, in the chapel of the Lady
  Superior of the Béguinage at Bruges, is only about 1 foot square. Brazen
  effigies are more numerous in England in the eastern and southern
  counties, than in parts more remote from the continent of Europe.</p>

  <p>Armorial bearings are displayed in a great variety of ways on
  monumental brasses, some of which are exhibited in the rubbings selected
  for illustration. In most cases separate shields are placed above and
  below the figures. They occur also in the spandrils of canopies and <!--
  Page 50 --><span class="pagenum" title="070.png"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>in the shafts and finials of the same, as
  well as in the centre and at the angles of border-fillets. They naturally
  predominate in the memorials of warriors, where we find them emblazoned
  not only on shield and pennon but on the scabbard and ailettes, and on
  the jupon, tabard, and cuirass also, while crests frequently occur on the
  tilting-helm. In one case (the brass of Sir Peter Legh, 1527, at Winwick,
  co. Lancaster) they figure upon the priestly chasuble. Walter Pescod, the
  merchant of Boston, Lincolnshire, 1398, wears a gown adorned with
  peascods&mdash;a play upon his name; and many a merchant's brass bears
  his coat of arms and merchant's mark beside, pointing a moral to not a
  few at the present day. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries witnessed
  the greatest profusion in heraldic decoration in brasses, when the tabard
  and the heraldic mantle were evolved. A good example of the former
  remains in the parish church of Ormskirk, Lancashire, in the brass
  commemorating a member of the Scarisbrick family, <i>c.</i> 1500 (Fig.
  21). Ladies were accustomed at this time to wear their husband's arms
  upon the mantle or outer garment and their own upon the kirtle, but the
  fashion which obtained at a subsequent period was to emblazon the
  husband's arms on the dexter and their own on the sinister side of the
  mantle (Fig. 22).</p>

  <p>The majority of such monuments, as we behold them now, are destitute
  of any indications of metals or tinctures, largely owing to the action of
  the varying degrees of temperature in causing contraction and expansion.
  Here and there, however, we may still detect traces of their pristine
  glory. But these matters received due attention from the engraver. To
  represent <i>or</i>, he left the surface of the brass untouched, except
  for gilding or perhaps polishing; this universal method has solved many
  heraldic problems. Lead or some other white metal was inlaid to indicate
  <i>argent</i>, and the various tinctures were supplied by the excision of
  a portion of the plate, thereby forming a depression, which was filled up
  by pouring in some resinous substance of the requisite colour. The
  various kinds of fur used in armory may be readily distinguished, with
  the sole exception of <i>vair</i> (<i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>), which
  presents the appearance of a row of small upright shields alternating
  with a similar row reversed.</p>

  <p>The earliest brass extant in England is that to Sir John D'Aubernoun,
  the elder (Fig. 23), at Stoke D'Abernon, in Surrey, which carries us back
  to the year 1277. The simple marginal inscription in Norman-French,
  surrounding the figure, and each Lombardic capital of which is set in its
  own matrix, reads: "Sire: John: Daubernoun: Chivaler: Gist: Icy: Deu: De:
  Sa: Alme: Eyt: Mercy:"<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> In
  the space <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum" title="071.png"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>between the inscription and the upper
  portion of the figure were two small shields, of which the dexter one
  alone remains, charged with the arms of the knight: "Azure, a chevron,
  or." Sir John D'Aubernoun is represented in a complete panoply of chain
  mail&mdash;his head being protected by a <i>coif de mailles</i>, which is
  joined to the <i>hauberk</i> or mail <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="072.png"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>shirt,
  which extends to the hands, having apparently no divisions for the
  fingers, and being tightened by straps at the wrists. The legs, which are
  not crossed, are covered by long <i>chausses</i>, or stockings of mail,
  <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum" title="073.png"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>protected at the knees by <i>poleyns</i> or
  <i>genouillères</i> of <i>cuir bouilli</i> richly ornamented by elaborate
  designs. A surcoat, probably of linen, depends from the shoulders to a
  little below the knees, and is cut away to a point above <!-- Page 54
  --><span class="pagenum" title="074.png"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>the knee. This garment is tightly confined
  (as the creases in the surcoat show) at the waist by a girdle, and over
  it is passed a <i>guige</i> whereto the long sword is attached. "Pryck"
  spurs are fixed to the instep, and the feet rest upon a lion, whose mouth
  grasps the lower portion of a lance. The lance bears a pennon charged
  with a chevron, as also is the small heater-shaped shield borne on the
  knight's left arm. The whole composition measures about eight feet by
  three.</p>

  <p>Heraldry figures more prominently in our second illustration, the
  brass to Sir Roger de Trumpington, 1289 (Fig. 24). This fine effigy lies
  under the canopy of an altar-tomb, so called, in the Church of St.
  Michael and All Angels, Trumpington, Cambridgeshire. It portrays the
  knight in armour closely resembling that already described, with these
  exceptions: the head rests upon a huge <i>heaume</i>, or tilting-helm,
  attached by a chain to the girdle, and the neck is here protected from
  side-thrusts by <i>ailettes</i> or oblong plates fastened behind the
  shoulders, and bearing the arms of Sir Roger. A dog here replaces the
  lion at the feet, the lance and pennon are absent, and the shield is
  rounded to the body. On this brass the arms not only occur upon the
  shield, but also upon the ailettes, and are four times repeated on the
  scabbard. They afford a good example of "canting" arms: "Azure, crusilly
  and two trumpets palewise or, with a label of five points in chief, for
  difference." It is interesting also to notice that the engraver had not
  <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum" title="075.png"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span>completed his task, for the short horizontal
  lines across the dexter side of the shield indicate his intention of
  cutting away the surface of the field.</p>

  <p>Sir Robert de Setvans (formerly Septvans), whose beautiful brass may

  <p>Our next example is a mural effigy to Sir William de Aldeburgh,
  <i>c.</i> 1360, from the north aisle of Aldborough Church, near
  Boroughbridge, Yorkshire (Fig. 26). He is attired like the "veray parfite
  gentil knight" of Chaucer, in a <i>bascinet</i> or steel cap, to which is
  laced the <i>camail</i> or tippet of chain mail, and a hauberk almost
  concealed by a <i>jupon</i>, whereon are emblazoned his arms: "Azure, a
  fess indented argent, between three crosslets botony, or." The first
  crosslet is charged with an annulet, probably as a mark of cadency. The
  engraver has omitted the indenture upon the fess, which, however, appears
  upon the shield. The knight's arms are protected by <i>epaulières</i>,
  <i>brassarts</i>, <i>coutes</i>, and <i>vambraces</i>; his hands, holding
  a heart, by gauntlets of steel. An elaborate baldric passes round his
  waist, from which are suspended, on the left, a cross-hilted sword, in a
  slightly ornamented scabbard; on the right, a <i>misericorde</i>, or
  dagger of mercy. The thighs are covered by cuisses&mdash;steel plates,
  here deftly concealed probably by satin or velvet secured by metal
  studs&mdash;the knees by <i>genouillères</i>, the lower leg by
  <i>jambes</i>, which reveal chausses of mail at the interstices.
  Sollerets, or long, pointed shoes, whereto are attached rowel spurs,
  complete his outfit. The figure stands upon a bracket bearing the name
  "Will's de Aldeburgh."</p>

  <p>The parish church of Eastington, Gloucestershire, contains a brass to
  Elizabeth Knevet, which is illustrated and described by Mr. Cecil T.
  Davis at p. 117 of his excellent work on the "Monumental Brasses of
  Gloucestershire."<a name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The
  block (Fig. 27), which presents a good example of the heraldic mantle,
  has been very kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Davis. To confine our
  description to the heraldic portion of the brass, we find the following
  arms upon the mantle:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Quarterly, 1. argent, a bend sable, within a bordure engrailed azure
  (Knevet); 2. argent, a bend azure, and chief, gules (Cromwell); 3. chequy
  or and gules, a chief ermine (Tatshall); 4. chequy or and gules, a bend
  ermine (De Cailly or Clifton); 5. paly of six within a bordure
  bezanté.... 6. bendy of six, a canton...."<a name="NtA_5"
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A coat of arms occurs also at each corner of the slab: "Nos. 1 and 4
  are on ordinary shields, and 2 and 3 on lozenges. Nos. 1 and <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum" title="076.png"><a

  on her mantle. No. 2, on a lozenge, quarterly, 1. Knevet; 2. Cromwell; 3.

  bendy of six, a canton; 8. or, a chevron gules (Stafford); 9. azure, a
  bend cottised between six lioncels rampant, or (de Bohun). No. 4 similar
  to No. 1, with the omission of 2 and 3."</p>

  <p>In later times thinner plates of metal were employed, a fact which
  largely contributed to preclude much of the boldness in execution
  hitherto displayed. A prodigality in shading, either by means of parallel
  lines or by cross-hatching, also tended to mar the beauty of later work
  of this kind. Nevertheless there are some good brasses of the Stuart
  period. These sometimes consist of a single quadrangular plate, with the
  upper portion occupied by armorial bearings and emblematical figures, the
  centre by an inscription, and the lower portion by a representation of
  the deceased, as at Forcett, in the North Riding of Yorkshire.
  Frequently, however, as at Rotherham and Rawmarsh, in the West Riding of
  the same county, the inscription is surmounted by a view of the whole
  family, the father kneeling on a cushion at a fald-stool, with his sons
  in a similar attitude behind him, and the mother likewise engaged with
  her daughters on the opposite side, while the armorial insignia find a
  place on separate shields above. <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum" title="077.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER V</h5>

<h5>THE COMPONENT PARTS OF AN ACHIEVEMENT</h5>

  <p>We now come to the science of armory and the rules governing the
  display of these marks of honour. The term "coat of arms," as we have
  seen, is derived from the textile garment or "surcoat" which was worn
  over the armour, and which bore in embroidery a duplication of the design
  upon the shield. There can be very little doubt that arms themselves are
  older than the fact of the surcoat or the term "coat of arms." The entire
  heraldic or armorial decoration which any one is entitled to bear may
  consist of many things. It must as a minimum consist of a shield of arms,
  for whilst there are many coats of arms in existence, and many still
  rightly in use at the present day, to which no crest belongs, a crest in
  this country cannot lawfully exist without its complementary coat of
  arms. For the last two certainly, and probably nearly three centuries, no
  original grant of personal arms has ever been issued without it
  containing the grant of a crest except in the case of a grant to a woman,
  who of course cannot bear or transmit a crest; or else in the case of
  arms borne in right of women or descent from women, through whom
  naturally no right to a crest could have been transmitted. The grants
  which I refer to as exceptions are those of quarterings and impalements
  to be borne with other arms, or else exemplifications following upon the
  assumption of name and arms which in fact and theory are regrants of
  previously existing arms, in which cases the regrant is of the original
  coat with or without a crest, as the case may be, and as the arms
  theretofor existed. Grants of impersonal arms also need not include a
  crest. As it has been impossible for the last two centuries to obtain a
  grant of arms without its necessarily accompanying grant of crest, a
  decided distinction attaches to the lawful possession of arms which have
  no crest belonging to them, for of necessity the arms must be at least
  two hundred years old. Bearing this in mind, one cannot but wonder at the
  actions of some ancient families like those of Astley and Pole, who,
  lawfully possessing arms concerning which there is and can be no doubt or
  question, yet nevertheless invent and use crests which have no
  authority.</p>

  <p>One instance and one only do I know where a crest has had a <!-- Page
  58 --><span class="pagenum" title="078.png"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>legitimate existence without any coat of
  arms. This case is that of the family of Buckworth, who at the time of
  the Visitations exhibited arms and crest. The arms infringed upon those
  of another family, and no sufficient proof could be produced to compel
  their admission as borne of right. The arms were respited for further
  proof, while the crest was allowed, presumably tentatively, and whilst
  awaiting the further proof for the arms; no proof, however, was made. The
  arms and crest remained in this position until the year 1806, when Sir
  Buckworth Buckworth-Herne, whose father had assumed the additional name
  of Herne, obtained a Royal Licence to bear the name of Soame in addition
  to and after those of Buckworth-Herne, with the arms of Soame quarterly
  with the arms of Buckworth. It then became necessary to prove the right
  to these arms of Buckworth, and they were accordingly regranted with the
  trifling addition of an ermine spot upon the chevron; consequently this
  solitary instance has now been rectified, and I cannot learn of any other
  instance where these exceptional circumstances have similarly occurred;
  and there never has been a grant of a crest alone unless arms have been
  in existence previously.</p>

  <p>Whilst arms may exist alone, and the decoration of a shield form the
  only armorial ensign of a person, such need not be the case; and it will
  usually be found that the armorial bearings of an ordinary commoner
  consist of shield, crest, and motto. To these must naturally be added the
  helmet and mantling, which become an essential to other than an
  abbreviated achievement when a crest has to be displayed. It should be
  remembered, however, that the helmet is not specifically granted, and
  apparently is a matter of inherent right, so that a person would not be
  in the wrong in placing a helmet and mantling above a shield even when no
  crest exists to surmount the helmet. The motto is usually to be found but
  is not a necessity, and there are many more coats of arms which have
  never been used with a motto than shields which exist without a crest.
  Sometimes a <i>cri-de-guerre</i> will be found instead of or in addition
  to a motto. The escutcheon may have supporters, or it may be displayed
  upon an eagle or a lymphad, &amp;c., for which particular additions no
  other generic term has yet been coined save the very inclusive one of
  "exterior ornaments." A coronet of rank may form a part of the
  achievement, and the shield may be encircled by the "ribbons" or the
  "circles" or by the Garter, of the various Orders of Knighthood, and by
  their collars. Below it may depend the badge of a Baronet of Nova Scotia,
  or of an Order of Knighthood, and added to it may possibly be what is
  termed a compartment, though this is a feature almost entirely peculiar
  to Scottish armory. There is also the crowning distinction of a badge;
  and of all armorial insignia this is the most cherished, for the existing
  badges <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum" title="079.png"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>are but few in number. The escutcheon may be
  placed in front of the crosiers of a bishop, the batons of the Earl
  Marshal, or similar ornaments. It may be displayed upon a mantle of
  estate, or it may be borne beneath a pavilion. With two more additions
  the list is complete, and these are the banner and the standard. For
  these several features of armory reference must be made to the various
  chapters in which they are treated.</p>

  <p>Suffice it here to remark that whilst the term "coat of arms" has
  through the slipshod habits of English philology come to be used to
  signify a representation of any heraldic bearing, the correct term for
  the whole emblazonment is an "achievement," a term most frequently
  employed to signify the whole, but which can correctly be used to signify
  anything which a man is entitled to represent of an armorial character.
  Had not the recent revival of interest in armory taken place, we should
  have found a firmly rooted and even yet more slipshod declension, for a
  few years ago the habit of the uneducated in styling anything stamped
  upon a sheet of note-paper "a crest," was fast becoming stereotyped into
  current acceptance. <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum" title="080.png"

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER VI</h5>

<h5>THE SHIELD</h5>

  <p>The shield is the most important part of the achievement, for on it
  are depicted the signs and emblems of the house to which it appertains;
  the difference marks expressive of the cadency of the members within that
  house; the augmentations of honour which the Sovereign has conferred; the
  quarterings inherited from families which are represented, and the
  impalements of marriage; and it is with the shield principally that the
  laws of armory are concerned, for everything else is dependent upon the
  shield, and falls into comparative insignificance alongside of it.</p>

  <p>Let us first consider the shield itself, without reference to the
  charges it carries. A shield may be depicted in any fashion and after any
  shape that the imagination can suggest, which shape and fashion have been
  accepted at any time as the shape and fashion of a shield. There is no
  law upon the subject. The various shapes adopted in emblazonments in past
  ages, and used at the present time in imitation of past usage&mdash;for
  luckily the present period has evolved no special shield of its
  own&mdash;are purely the result of artistic design, and have been
  determined at the periods they have been used in heraldic art by no other
  consideration than the particular theory of design that has happened to
  dominate the decoration, and the means and ends of such decoration of
  that period. The lozenge certainly is reserved for and indicative of the
  achievements of the female sex, but, save for this one exception, the
  matter may be carried further, and arms be depicted upon a banner, a
  parallelogram, a square, a circle, or an oval; and even then one would be
  correct, for the purposes of armory, in describing such figures as
  shields on all occasions on which they are made the vehicles for the
  emblazonment of a design which properly and originally should be borne
  upon a shield. Let no one think that a design ceases to be a coat of arms
  if it is not displayed upon a shield. Many people have thought to evade
  the authority of the Crown as the arbiter of coat-armour, and the
  penalties of taxation imposed by the Revenue by using designs without
  depicting them upon a shield. This little deception has always been borne
  in mind, <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum" title="081.png"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>for we find in the Royal Warrants of Queen
  Elizabeth commanding the Visitations that the King of Arms to whom the
  warrant was addressed was to "correcte, cumptrolle and refourme all mann'
  of armes, crests, cognizaunces and devices unlawfull or unlawfully
  usurped, borne or taken by any p'son or p'sons within the same p'vince
  cont<sup>a</sup>ry to the due order of the laws of armes, and the same to
  rev'se, put downe or otherwise deface at his discrecon as well in coote
  armors, helmes, standerd, pennons and hatchmets of tents and pavilions,
  as also in plate jewells, pap', parchement, wyndowes, gravestones and
  monuments, or elsewhere wheresoev' they be sett or placed, whether they
  be in shelde, schoocheon, lozenge, square, rundell or otherwise howsoev'
  cont<sup>a</sup>rie to the autentiq' and auncient lawes, customes, rules,
  privileges and orders of armes."</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    28.</span>&mdash;Taken from the tomb of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of
    Anjou.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Act 32 &amp; 33 Victoria, section 19, defines (for the purpose of
  the taxation it enforced) armorial bearings to mean and include "any
  armorial bearing, crest, or ensign, by whatever name the same shall be
  called, and whether such armorial bearing, crest, or ensign shall be
  registered in the College of Arms or not."</p>

  <p>The shape of the shield throughout the rest of Europe has also varied
  between wide extremes, and at no time has any one particular shape been
  assigned to or peculiar to any country, rank, or condition, save possibly
  with one exception, namely, that the use of the cartouche or oval seems
  to have been very nearly universal with ecclesiastics in France, Spain,
  and Italy, though never reserved exclusively for their use. Probably this
  was an attempt on the part of the Church to get away from the military
  character of the shield. It is in keeping with the rule by which, even at
  the present day, a bishop or a cardinal bears neither helmet nor crest,
  using in place thereof his ecclesiastical mitre or tasselled hat, and by
  which the clergy, both abroad and in this country, seldom made use of a
  crest in depicting their arms. A clergyman in this country, however, has
  never been denied the right of using a crest (if he possesses one and
  chooses to display it) until he reaches episcopal rank. A grant of arms
  to a clergyman at the present day depicts his achievement with helmet,
  mantling, and crest in identical form with those adopted for any one
  else. But the laws of armory, official and amateur, have always denied
  the right to make use of a crest to bishop, archbishop, and cardinal.</p>

  <p>At the present day, if a grant of arms is made to a bishop of the
  Established Church, the emblazonment at the head of his patent consists
  of shield and mitre only. The laws of the Church of England, however,
  require no vow of celibacy from its ecclesiastics, and consequently the
  descendants of a bishop would be placed in the position of having no
  crest to display if the bishop and his requirements were <!-- Page 62
  --><span class="pagenum" title="082.png"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span>alone considered. So that in the case of a
  grant to a bishop the crest is granted for his descendants in a separate
  clause, being depicted by itself in the body of the patent apart from the
  emblazonment "in the margin hereof," which in an ordinary patent is an
  emblazonment of the whole achievement. A similar method is usually
  adopted in cases in which the actual patentee is a woman, and where, by
  the limitations attached to the patent being extended beyond herself,
  males are brought in who will bear the arms granted to the patentee as
  their pronominal arms. In these cases the arms of the patentee are
  depicted upon a lozenge at the head of the patent, the crest being
  depicted separately elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Whilst shields were actually used in warfare the utilitarian article
  largely governed the shape of the artistic representation, but after the
  fifteenth century the latter gradually left the beaten track of utility
  and passed wholly into the cognisance of art and design. The earliest
  shape of all is the long, narrow shape, which is now but seldom seen.
  This was curved to protect the body, which it nearly covered, and an
  interesting example of this is to be found in the monumental slab of
  champlevé enamel, part of the tomb of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of
  Anjou (Fig. 28), the ancestor of our own Royal dynasty of Plantagenet,
  who died in the year 1150. This tomb was formerly in the cathedral of Le
  Mans, and is now in the museum there. I shall have occasion again to
  refer to it. The shield is blue; the lions are gold.</p>

  <p>Other forms of the same period are found with curved tops, in the
  shape of an inverted pear, but the form known as the heater-shaped shield
  is to all intents and purposes the earliest shape which was used for
  armorial purposes.</p>

  <p>The church of St. Elizabeth at Marburg, in Hesse, affords examples of
  shields which are exceedingly interesting, inasmuch as they are <!-- Page
  63 --><span class="pagenum" title="083.png"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>original and contemporary even if only
  pageant shields. Those which now remain are the shields of the Landgrave
  Konrad (<i>d.</i> 1241) of Thuringia and of Henry of Thuringia (<i>d.</i>
  1298). The shield of the former (see Fig. 29) is 90 centimetres high and
  74 wide. Konrad was Landgrave of Thuringia and Grand Master of the
  Teutonic Order of Knighthood. His arms show the lion of Thuringia barry
  of gules and argent on a field of azure, and between the hind feet a
  small shield, with the arms of the Teutonic Order of Knights. The only
  remains of the lion's mane are traces of the nails. The body of the lion
  is made of pressed leather, and the yellow claws have been supplied with
  a paint-brush. A precious stone probably represented the eye.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The making and decorating of the shields lay mostly in the hands of
  the herald painters, known in Germany as <i>Schilter</i>, who, in
  addition to attending to the shield and crest, also had charge of all the
  riding paraphernalia, because most of the articles comprised therein were
  <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum" title="084.png"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span>heraldically decorated. Many of these
  shield-workers' fraternities won widespread fame for themselves, and
  enjoyed great consideration at that time.</p>

  <p>Thus the "History of a Celebrated Painters' Guild on the Lower Rhine"
  tells us of costly shields which the shield-workers of Paris had
  supplied, 1260, &amp;c. Vienna, too, was the home of a not unimportant
  shield-workers' guild, and the town archives of Vienna contain writings
  of the fifteenth century treating of this subject. For instance, we learn
  that in an order of St. Luke's parish, June 28, 1446, with regard to the
  masterpiece of a member of the guild&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Item, a shield-worker shall make four new pieces of work with his own
  hand, a jousting saddle, a leather apron, a horse's head-piece, and a
  jousting shield, that shall he do in eight weeks, and must be able to
  paint it with his own hand, as Knight and man-at-arms shall direct."</p>

  <p>The shield was of wood, covered with linen or leather, the charges in
  relief and painted. Leather plastic was very much esteemed in the early
  Middle Ages. The leather was soaked in oil, and pressed or beaten into
  shape. Besides piecing and leather plastic, pressed linen (linen dipped
  in chalk and lime) was also used, and a kind of tempera painting on a
  chalk background. After the shield was decorated with the charges, it was
  frequently strengthened with metal clasps, or studs, particularly those
  parts which were more especially exposed to blows and pressure. These
  clasps and nails originally had no other object than to make the shield
  stronger and more durable, but later on their nature was misunderstood;
  they were treated and used as genuine heraldic charges, and stereotyped
  into hereditary designs. The long strips with which the edge was bound
  were called the "frame" (<i>Schildgestell</i>), the clasps introduced in
  the middle of the shield the "buckle" or "umbo" (see on Fig. 28), from
  which frequently circularly arranged metal snaps reached the edge of the
  shield. This latter method of strengthening the shield was called the
  "Buckelrîs," a figure which was afterwards frequently employed as a
  heraldic charge, and is known in Germany by the name of
  <i>Lilienhaspel</i> (Lily-staple) or <i>Glevenrad</i>, or, as we term it
  in England, the escarbuncle.</p>

  <p>In the second half of the fourteenth century, when the tournament
  provided the chief occasion for the shield, the jousting-shield, called
  in Germany the <i>Tartsche</i> or <i>Tartscher</i>, came into use, and
  from this class of shield the most varied shapes were gradually
  developed. These <i>Tartschen</i> were decidedly smaller than the earlier
  Gothic shields, being only about one-fifth of a man's height. They were
  concave, and had on the side of the knight's right hand a circular
  indentation. This was the spear-rest, in which to place the
  tilting-spear. The later <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum" title="087.png"
  ><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>art of heraldic decoration symmetrically
  repeated the spear-rest on the sinister side of the shield, and, by so
  doing, transformed a useful fact into a matter of mere artistic design.
  Doubtless it was argued that if indentations were correct at one point in
  the outline they were correct at another, and when once the actual fact
  was departed from the imagination of designers knew no limits. But if the
  spear-rest as such is introduced into the outline of a shield it should
  be on the dexter side.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 32.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Reverting to the various shapes of shield, however, the degeneration
  is explained by a remark of Mr. G. W. Eve in the able book which he has
  recently published under the title of "Decorative Heraldry," in which,
  alluding to heraldic art in general, he says (p. 235):&mdash;</p>

  <p>"With the Restoration heraldry naturally became again conspicuous,
  with the worst form of the Renaissance character in full sway, the last
  vestiges of the Gothic having disappeared. Indeed, the contempt with
  which the superseded style was regarded amounted to fanaticism, and
  explains, in a measure, how so much of good could be relinquished in
  favour of so weak a successor."</p>

  <p>Later came the era of gilded embellishments, of flowing palms, of
  borders decorated with grinning heads, festoons of ribbon, and fruit and
  flowers in abundance. The accompanying examples are reproduced from a
  book, Knight and Rumley's "Heraldry." The book is not particularly well
  known to the public, inasmuch as its circulation was entirely confined to
  heraldic artists, coach-painters, engravers, and die-sinkers. Amongst
  these handicraftsmen its reputation was and is great. With the school of
  design it adopted, little or no sympathy now exists, but a short time ago
  (how short many of those who are now vigorous advocates of the Gothic and
  mediæval styles would be startled to realise were they to recognise
  actual facts) no other style was known or considered by the public. As
  examples of that style the plates of Knight and Rumley were admittedly
  far in advance of any other book, and as specimens of copperplate
  engraving they are superb. Figs. 30, 31, and 32 show typical examples of
  escutcheons from Knight and Rumley; and as the volume was in the hands of
  most of the heraldic handicraftsmen, it will be found that this type of
  design was constantly to be met with. The external decoration of the
  shield was carried to great lengths, and Fig. 31 found many admirers and
  users amongst the gallant "sea-dogs" of the kingdom. In fact, so far was
  the idea carried that a trophy of military weapons was actually granted
  by patent as part of the supporters of the Earl of Bantry. Fig. 30, from
  the same source, is the military equivalent. These plates are interesting
  as being some of the examples from which most of the heraldic handicraft
  of a recent period was adapted. The <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum" title="088.png"
  ><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>official shield eventually stereotyped
  itself into a shape akin to that shown in Fig. 32, though nowadays
  considerable latitude is permitted. For paintings which are not upon
  patents the design of the shield rests with the individual taste of the
  different officers of arms, and recently some of the work for which they
  have been responsible has reached a high standard judged even by the
  strictest canons of art. In Scotland, until very recently, the actual
  workmanship of the emblazonments which were issued from Lyon Office was
  so wretchedly poor that one is hardly justified in taking them into
  consideration as a type. With the advent into office of the present Lyon
  King of Arms (Sir James Balfour Paul), a complete change has been made,
  and both the workmanship and design of the paintings upon the patents of
  grant and matriculation, and also in the Lyon Register, have been
  examples of everything that could be desired. <!-- Page 67 --><span

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER VII</h5>

<h5>THE FIELD OF A SHIELD AND THE HERALDIC TINCTURES</h5>

  <p>The shield itself and its importance in armory is due to its being the
  vehicle whereon are elaborated the pictured emblems and designs which
  constitute coat-armour. It should be borne in mind that theoretically all
  shields are of equal value, saving that a shield of more ancient date is
  more estimable than one of recent origin, and the shield of the head of
  the house takes precedence of the same arms when differenced for a
  younger member of the family. A shield crowded with quarterings is
  interesting inasmuch as each quartering in the ordinary event means the
  representation through a female of some other family or branch thereof.
  But the real value of such a shield should be judged rather by the age of
  the single quartering which represents the strict male descent male upon
  male, and a simple coat of arms without quarterings may be a great deal
  more ancient and illustrious than a shield crowded with coat upon coat. A
  fictitious and far too great estimation is placed upon the right to
  display a long string of quarterings. In reality quarterings are no more
  than accidents, because they are only inherited when the wife happens to
  be an heiress in blood. It is quite conceivable that there may be
  families, in fact there are such families, who are able to begin their
  pedigrees at the time of the Conquest, and who have married a long
  succession of noble women, all of the highest birth, but yet none of whom
  have happened to be heiresses. Consequently the arms, though dating from
  the earliest period at which arms are known, would remain in their simple
  form without the addition of a solitary quartering. On the other hand, I
  have a case in mind of a marriage which took place some years ago. The
  husband is the son of an alien whose original position, if report speaks
  truly, was that of a pauper immigrant. His wealth and other attributes
  have placed him in a good social position; but he has no arms, and, as
  far as the world is aware, no ancestry whatever. Let us now consider his
  wife's family. Starting soon after the Conquest, its descendants obtained
  high position and married heiress after heiress, and before the
  commencement of this century had amassed a shield of quarterings which
  can readily be proved to be little short of a hundred in number. Probably
  the number <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum" title="090.png"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span>is really much greater. A large family
  followed in one generation, and one of the younger sons is the ancestor
  of the aforesaid wife. But the father of this lady never had any sons,
  and though there are many males of the name to carry on the family in the
  senior line and also in several younger branches, the wife, by the
  absence of brothers, happens to be a coheir; and as such she transmits to
  her issue the right to all the quarterings she has inherited. If the
  husband ever obtains a grant of arms, the date of them will be subsequent
  to the present time; but supposing such a grant to be obtained, the
  children will inevitably inherit the scores of quarterings which belong
  to their mother. Now it would be ridiculous to suppose that such a shield
  is better or such a descent more enviable than the shield of a family
  such as I first described. Quarterings are all very well in their way,
  but their glorification has been carried too far.</p>

  <p>A shield which displays an augmentation is of necessity more
  honourable than one without. At the same time no scale of precedence has
  ever been laid down below the rank of esquires; and if such precedence
  does really exist at all, it can only be according to the date of the
  grant. Here in England the possession of arms carries with it no style or
  title, and nothing in his designation can differentiate the position of
  Mr. Scrope of Danby, the male descendant of one of the oldest families in
  this country, whose arms were upheld in the Scrope and Grosvenor
  controversy in 1390, or Mr. Daubeney of Cote, from a Mr. Smith, whose
  known history may have commenced at the Foundling Hospital twenty years
  ago. In this respect English usage stands apart, for whilst a German is
  "Von" and a Frenchman was "De," if of noble birth, there is no such
  apparent distinction in England, and never has been. The result has been
  that the technical nobility attaching to the possession of arms is
  overlooked in this country. On the Continent it is usual for a patent
  creating a title to contain a grant of the arms, because it is recognised
  that the two are inseparable. This is not now the case in England, where
  the grant of arms is one thing and the grant of the title another, and
  where it is possible, as in the case of Lord St. Leonards, to possess a
  peerage without ever having obtained the first step in rank, which is
  nobility or gentility.</p>

  <p>The foregoing is in explanation of the fact that except in the matter
  of date all shields are equal in value.</p>

  <p>So much being understood, it is possible to put that consideration on
  one side, and speaking from the artistically technical point of view, the
  remark one often hears becomes correct, that the simpler a coat of arms
  the better. The remark has added truth from the fact that most ancient
  coats of arms were simple, and many modern coats are far from being
  worthy of such a description. <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum" title="091.png"
  ><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span></p>

  <p>A coat of arms must consist of at least one thing, to wit, the
  "field." This is equivalent in ordinary words to the colour of the ground
  of the shield. A great many writers have asserted that every coat of arms
  must consist of at least the field, and a charge, though most have
  mentioned as a solitary exception the arms of Brittany, which were simply
  "ermine." A plain shield of ermine (Fig. 33) was borne by John of
  Brittany, Earl of Richmond (<i>d.</i> 1399), though some of his
  predecessors had relegated the arms of Brittany to a "quarter ermine"
  upon more elaborate escutcheons (Fig. 61). This idea as to arms of one
  tincture was, however, exploded in Woodward and Burnett's "Treatise on
  Heraldry," where no less than forty different examples are quoted. The
  above-mentioned writer continues: "There is another use of a plain red
  shield which must not be omitted. In the full quartered coat of some high
  sovereign princes of Germany&mdash;Saxony (duchies), Brandenburg
  (Prussia), Bavaria, Anhalt&mdash;appears a plain red quartering; this is
  known as the <i>Blut Fahne</i> or <i>Regalien</i> quarter, and is
  indicative of Royal prerogatives. It usually occupies the base of the
  shield, and is often diapered."</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:14%;">
      <a href="images/fig033.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig033.png"

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Arms
    of John (de Montfort, otherwise de Bretagne), Duke of Brittany and Earl
    of Richmond. (From his seal.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>But in spite of the lengthy list which is quoted in Woodward and
  Burnett, the fact remains that only one British instance is included. The
  family of Berington of Chester (on the authority of Harleian manuscript
  No. 1535) is said to bear a plain shield of azure. Personally I doubt
  this coat of arms for the Berington family of Chester, which is probably
  connected with the neighbouring family in Shropshire, who in later times
  certainly used very different arms. The plain shield of ermine is
  sometimes to be found as a quartering for Brittany in the achievement of
  those English families who have the right to quarter the Royal arms; but
  I know of no other British case in which, either as a quartering or as a
  pronominal coat, arms of one tincture exist.</p>

  <p>But there are many coats which have no charge, the distinctive device
  consisting of the partition of the shield in some recognised heraldic
  method into two or more divisions of different tinctures. Amongst such
  coats may be mentioned the arms of Waldegrave, which are simply: Party
  per pale argent and gules; Drummond of Megginch, whose arms are simply:
  Party per fess wavy or and gules; and the arms of Boyle, which are: Per
  bend embattled argent and gules. The arms of Berners&mdash;which are:
  Quarterly or and vert&mdash;are another example, as are the arms of
  Campbell (the first quarter in the Duke of Argyll's achievement), which
  are: Gyronny or and sable. <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum" title="092.png"
  ><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span></p>

  <p>The coat bendy argent and gules, the ancient arms of Talbot, which are
  still borne as a quartering by the Earl of Shrewsbury, Waterford, and
  Talbot; and the coat chequy or and azure, a quartering for Warren, which
  is still borne by the House of Howard, all come within the same category.
  There are many other coats of this character which have no actual charge
  upon them.</p>

  <p>The colour of the shield is termed the field when it consists of only
  one colour, and when it consists of more than one colour the two together
  compose the field. The field is usually of one or more of the recognised
  metals, colours, or furs.</p>

  <p>The metals are gold and silver, these being termed "or" and "argent."
  The colours, which are really the "tinctures," if this word is to be used
  correctly, are: gules (red), azure (blue), vert (green), purpure
  (purple), and (in spite of the fact that it is not really a colour)
  black, which is known as sable.</p>

  <p>The metal gold, otherwise "or," is often represented in emblazonments
  by yellow: as a matter of fact yellow has always been used for gold in
  the Register Books of the College of Arms, and Lyon Office has recently
  reverted to this practice. In ancient paintings and emblazonments the use
  of yellow was rather more frequent than the use of gold, but gold at all
  times had its use, and was never discarded. Gold seems to have been
  usually used upon ancient patents, whilst yellow was used in the
  registrations of them retained in the Offices of Arms, but I know of no
  instance in British armory in which the word yellow has been used in a
  blazon to represent any tint distinct from gold. With regard to the other
  metal, silver, or, as it is always termed, "argent," the same variation
  is found in the usage of silver and white in representing argent that we
  find in yellow and gold, though we find that the use of the actual metal
  (silver) in emblazonment does not occur to anything like the same extent
  as does the use of gold. Probably this is due to the practical difficulty
  that no one has yet discovered a silver medium which does not lose its
  colour. The use of aluminium was thought to have solved the difficulty,
  but even this loses its brilliancy, and probably its usage will never be
  universally adopted. This is a pity, for the use of gold in emblazonments
  gives a brilliancy in effect to a collection of coat-armour which it is a
  pity cannot be extended by an equivalent usage of silver. The use of
  silver upon the patents at the College of Arms has been discontinued some
  centuries, though aluminium is still in use in Lyon Office. Argent is
  therefore usually represented either by leaving the surface untouched, or
  by the use of Chinese white.</p>

  <p>I believe I am the first heraldic writer to assert the existence of
  the heraldic colour of white in addition to the heraldic argent. Years
  ago <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum" title="093.png"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>I came across the statement that a white
  label belonged only to the Royal Family, and could be used by no one
  else. I am sorry to say that though I have searched high and low I cannot
  find the authority for the statement, nor can I learn from any officer of
  arms that the existence of such a rule is asserted; but there is this
  curious confirmation that in the warrants by which the various labels are
  assigned to the different members of the Royal Family, the labels are
  called white labels. Now the label of the Prince of Wales is of three
  points and is plain. Heraldry knows nothing of the black lines which in
  drawing a coat of arms usually appear for the outline of a charge. In
  older work such lines are absent. In any case they are only mere
  accidents of draughtsmanship. Bearing this in mind, and bearing in mind
  that the sinister supporter of the Prince of Wales is a unicorn argent,
  how on earth is a plain label of argent to be depicted thereupon? Now it
  is necessary also that the label shall be placed upon the crest, which is
  a lion statant guardant or, crowned with the coronet of the Prince, and
  upon the dexter supporter which is another golden lion; to place an
  argent label upon either is a flat violation of the rule which requires
  that metal shall not be placed upon metal, nor colour upon colour; but if
  the unicorn is considered argent, which it is, it would if really
  depicted in silver be quite possible to paint a white label upon it, for
  the distinction between white and silver is marked, and a white label
  upon a gold lion is not metal upon metal. Quite recently a still further
  and startling confirmation has come under my notice. In the grant of a
  crest to Thomas Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham, the coronet which is to
  encircle the neck of the leopard is distinctly blazoned argent, the label
  to which he is previously said to have had a just hereditary right is as
  distinctly blazoned white, and the whole grant is so short that
  inadvertence could hardly be pleaded as an explanation for the
  distinction in blazon. Instances of an official exemplification of coats
  of arms with labels are not uncommon, because the label in some number of
  families, for example Courtenay and Prideaux-Brune and Barrington, has
  become stereotyped into a charge. In none of these cases, however, is it
  either argent or white, but instances of the exemplification of a coat of
  arms bearing a label as a mark of cadency are, outside the members of the
  Royal Family, distinctly rare; they are necessarily so, because outside
  the Royal Family the label is merely the temporary mark of the eldest son
  or grandson during the lifetime of the head of the house, and the
  necessity for the exemplification of the arms of an eldest son can seldom
  occur. The one circumstance which might provide us with the opportunity
  is the exemplification consequent upon a change of name and arms by an
  eldest son during the lifetime of his father; but <!-- Page 72 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="094.png"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>this very
  circumstance fails to provide it, because the exemplification only
  follows a change of arms, and the arms being changed, there no longer
  exists the necessity for a mark of cadency; so that instances of the
  official use of a label for cadency are rare, but of such as occur I can
  learn of none which has received official sanction which blazons the
  label white. There is, however, one coat which is said to have a label
  argent as a charge, this is the coat of Fitz-Simon, which is quoted in
  Papworth, upon the authority of one of the Harleian Manuscripts, as
  follows: Sable, three crescents, in chief a label of two drops and in
  fess another of one drop argent; and the same coat of arms is recorded in
  a funeral entry in Ulster's Office. The label is not here termed white,
  and it is peculiar that we find it of another colour in another coat of
  Fitz-Simon (azure, a lion rampant ermine, a label of four point
  gules).</p>

  </div>

  <p>Of other colours may be mentioned purpure (purple). This in English
  heraldry is a perfectly well recognised colour, and though its use is
  extremely rare in comparison with the others, it will be found too
  frequently for it to be classed as an exception. The earliest instance of
  this tincture which I have met with is in the coat of De Lacy (Fig. 34).
  The Roll of Caerlaverock speaks of his</p>

  <p>whilst MS. Cott. Calig. A. xviii. quotes the arms: "<i>De or, a un
  lion rampaund de pourpre</i>." The Burton coat of the well-known
  Shropshire family of Lingen-Burton is: Quarterly purpure and azure, a
  cross engrailed or between four roses argent. The Irish baronets of the
  name of Burton, who claimed descent from this family, bore a very similar
  coat, namely: Per pale azure and purpure, a cross engrailed or between
  four roses argent.</p>

  <p>Two other colours will be found in nearly all text-books of English
  armory. These are murrey or sanguine, and orange or tenné. The exact tint
  of murrey is between gules and purpure; and tenné is an orange-tawny
  colour. They are both "stains," and were perhaps invented by the old
  heralds for the perpetration of their preposterous system of abatements,
  which will be found set out in full in the old heraldry books, but which
  have yet to be found occurring in fact. The subject of abatements is one
  of those pleasant little insanities which have done so much to the
  detriment of heraldry. One, and one only, can be said <!-- Page 73
  --><span class="pagenum" title="095.png"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>to have had the slightest foundation in
  fact; that was the entire reversal of the escutcheon in the ceremony of
  degradation following upon attainder for high treason. Even this,
  however, was but temporary, for a man forfeited his arms entirely by
  attainder. They were torn down from his banner of knighthood; they were
  erased in the records of the College of Arms; but on that one single
  occasion when he was drawn upon a hurdle to the place of his execution,
  they are said to have been painted reversed upon paper, which paper was
  fastened to his breast. But the arms then came to an end, and his
  descendants possessed none at all. They certainly had not the right to
  depict their shield upside down (even if they had cared to display such a
  monstrosity). Unless and until the attainder was reversed, arms (like a
  title) were void; and the proof of this is to be found in the many
  regrants of arms made in cases where the attainder has remained, as in
  the instances of the Earl of Stafford and the ancestor of the present
  Lord Barnard. But that any person should have been supposed to have been
  willing to make use of arms carrying an abatement is preposterous, and no
  instance of such usage is known. Rather would a man decline to bear arms
  at all; and that any one should have imagined the existence of a person
  willing to advertise himself as a drunkard or an adulterer, with
  variations in the latter case according to the personality of his partner
  in guilt, is idiotic in the extreme. Consequently, as no example of an
  abatement has ever been found, one might almost discard the "stains" of
  murrey and tenné were it not that they were largely made use of for the
  purposes of liveries, in which usage they had no such objectionable
  meaning. At the present day scarlet or gules being appropriated to the
  Royal Family for livery purposes, other people possessing a shield of
  gules are required to make use of a different red, and though it is now
  termed chocolate or claret colour by the utilitarian language of the day,
  it is in reality nothing more than the old sanguine or murrey. Of
  orange-tawny I can learn of but one livery at the present day. I refer to
  the orange-tawny coats used by the hunt servants of Lord Fitzhardinge,
  and now worn by the hunt servants of the Old Berkeley country, near
  London. <i>A propos</i> of this it is interesting to note the curious
  legend that the "pink" of the hunting field is not due to any reasons of
  optical advantage, but to an entirely different reason. Formerly no man
  might hunt even on his own estate until he had had licence of free warren
  from the Crown. Consequently he merely hunted by the pleasure of the
  Crown, taking part in what was exclusively a Royal sport by Royal
  permission, and for this Royal sport he wore the King's livery of
  scarlet. This being the case, it is a curious anomaly that although the
  livery of the only Royal pack recently in existence, the Royal Buck
  Hounds, was scarlet and gold, the Master <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="096.png"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>wore a
  green coat. The legend may be a fallacy, inasmuch as scarlet did not
  become the Royal livery until the accession of the Stuarts; but it is by
  no means clear to what date the scarlet hunting coat can be traced.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one undoubted instance of the use of sanguine for
  the field of a coat of arms, namely, the arms of Clayhills of
  Invergowrie,<a name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> which are
  properly matriculated in Lyon Register.</p>

  <p>To these colours German heraldry has added brown, blood-red (this
  apparently is different from the English sanguine, as a different
  hatching has been invented for it), earth-colour, iron-grey,
  water-colour, flesh-colour, ashen-grey, orange (here also a separate
  hatching from the one to represent tenné has been invented), and the
  colour of nature, <i>i.e.</i> "proper." These doubtless are not intended
  to be added to the list of heraldic tinctures, but are noted because
  various hatchings have been invented in modern times to represent
  them.</p>

  <p>Mr. Woodward, in Woodward and Burnett's "Treatise on Heraldry,"
  alludes to various tinctures amongst Continental arms which he has come
  across.</p>

  <p>"Besides the metals, tinctures, and furs which have been already
  described, other tinctures are occasionally found in the Heraldry of
  Continental nations; but are comparatively of such rarity as that they
  may be counted among the curiosities of blazon, which would require a
  separate volume. That of which I have collected instances is Cendrée, or
  ash colour, which is borne by (among others) the Bavarian family of
  Ashua, as its <i>armes parlantes: Cendrée, a mount of three coupeaux in
  base or</i>.</p>

  <p>"<i>Brunâtre</i>, a brown colour, is even more rare as a tincture of
  the field; the <span class="sc">Mieroszewsky</span> in Silesia bear,
  '<i>de Brunâtre, A cross patée argent supporting a raven rising sable,
  and holding in its beak a horseshoe proper, its points towards the
  chief</i>."</p>

  <p>"<i>Bleu-céleste</i>, or <i>bleu du ciel</i>, appears occasionally,
  apart from what we may term 'landscape coats.' That it differs from, and
  is a much lighter colour than, azure is shown by the following example.
  The Florentine <span class="sc">Cinti</span> (now <span
  class="sc">Cini</span>) bear a coat which would be numbered among the
  <i>armes fausses, or à enquérir: Per pale azure and bleu-céleste, an
  estoile counterchanged</i>."</p>

  <p>"<i>Amaranth</i> or <i>columbine</i> is the field of a coat (of which
  the blazon is too lengthy for insertion in this place) which was granted
  to a Bohemian knight in 1701."</p>

  <p>Carnation is the French term for the colour of naked flesh, and is
  often employed in the blazonry of that country. <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="097.png"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span></p>

  <p>Perhaps mention should here be made of the English term "proper."
  Anything, alive or otherwise, which is depicted in its natural colours is
  termed "proper," and it should be depicted in its really correct tones or
  tints, without any attempt to assimilate these with any heraldic
  tincture. It will not be found in the very ancient coats of arms, and its
  use is not to be encouraged. When a natural animal is found existing in
  various colours it is usual to so describe it, for the term "proper"
  alone would leave uncertainty. For instance, the crest of the Lane
  family, which was granted to commemorate the ride of King Charles II.
  behind Mistress Jane Lane as her servant, in his perilous escape to the
  coast after the disastrous Battle of Worcester, is blazoned "a strawberry
  roan horse, couped at the flanks proper, bridled sable, and holding
  between the feet an Imperial crown also proper." Lord Cowper's supporters
  were, on either side of the escutcheon, "a light dun horse proper, with a
  large blaze down the face, the mane close shorn except a tuft on the
  withers, a black list down the back, a bob tail, and the near fore-foot
  and both hind feet white." Another instance that might be quoted are the
  supporters of Lord Newlands, which are: "On either side a dapple-grey
  horse proper, gorged with a riband and suspended therefrom an escutcheon
  gules, charged with three bezants in chevron." The crest of the family of
  Bewes, of St. Neots, Cornwall, is: "On a chapeau gules, turned up ermine,
  a pegasus rearing on his hind legs of a bay colour, the mane and tail
  sable, winged or, and holding in the mouth a sprig of laurel proper."</p>

  <p>There are and were always many occasions in which it was desired to
  represent armorial bearings in black and white, or where from the nature
  of the handicraft it was impossible to make use of actual colour. But it
  should always be pointedly remembered that unless the right colours of
  the arms could be used the tinctures were entirely ignored in all matters
  of handicraft until the seventeenth century. Various schemes of
  hatchings, however, were adopted for the purpose of indicating the real
  heraldic colours when arms were represented and the real colours could
  not be employed, the earliest being that of Francquart in Belgium,
  <i>circa</i> 1623. Woodward says this was succeeded by the systems of
  Butkens, 1626; Petra Sancta, 1638; Lobkowitz, 1639; Gelenius; and De
  Rouck, 1645; but all these systems differed from each other, and were for
  a time the cause of confusion and not of order. Eventually, however, the
  system of Petra Sancta (the author of <i>Tesseræ Gentilitia</i>)
  superseded all the others, and has remained in use up to the present
  time.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">

      alt="Fig. 35." title="Fig. 35." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 35.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Upon this point Herr Ströhl in his <i>Heraldischer Atlas</i> remarks:
  "The system of hatching used by Marcus Vulson de la Colombière, 1639, in
  the course of time found acceptance everywhere, and has <!-- Page 76
  --><span class="pagenum" title="098.png"><a
  name="page76"></a>{76}</span>maintained itself in use unaltered until the
  present day, and these are shown in Fig. 35, only that later, hatchings
  have been invented for brown, grey, &amp;c.; which, however, seems rather
  a superfluous enriching." None of these later creations, by the way, have
  ever been used in this country. For the sake of completeness, however,
  let them be mentioned (see Fig. 36): <i>a</i>, brown; <i>b</i>,
  blood-red; <i>c</i>, earth-colour; <i>d</i>, iron-grey; <i>e</i>,
  water-colour; <i>f</i>, flesh-colour; <i>g</i>, ashen-grey; <i>h</i>,
  orange; and <i>i</i>, colour of nature. In English armory "tenné" is
  represented by a combination of horizontal (as azure) lines with diagonal
  lines from sinister to dexter (as purpure), and sanguine or murrey by a
  combination of diagonal lines from dexter to sinister (as vert), and from
  sinister to dexter (as purpure).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/fig036.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig036.png"
      alt="Fig. 36." title="Fig. 36." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 36.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>The hatchings of the shield and its charges always accommodate
  themselves to the angle at which the shield is placed, those of the crest
  to the angle of the helmet. A curious difficulty, however, occurs when a
  shield, as is so often the case in this country, forms a part of the
  crest. Such a shield is seldom depicted quite upright upon the wreath.
  Are the tincture lines to follow the angle of the smaller shield in the
  crest or the angle of the helmet? Opinion is by no means agreed upon the
  point.</p>

  <p>But though this system of representing colours by "hatching" has been
  adopted and extensively made use of, it is questionable whether <!-- Page
  77 --><span class="pagenum" title="099.png"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>it has ever received official sanction, at
  any rate in Great Britain. It certainly has never been made use of in any
  <i>official</i> record or document in the College of Arms. Most of the
  records are in colour. The remainder are all without exception "tricked,"
  that is, drawn in outline, the colours being added in writing in the
  following contracted forms: "O," or "or," for or; "A," "ar," or "arg,"
  for argent; "G," or "gu," for gules; "Az," or "B" (for blue, owing to the
  likelihood of confusion between "ar" and "az," "B" being almost
  universally used in old trickings), for azure; "S," or "sa," for sable;
  "Vt" for vert, and "Purp" for purpure. It is unlikely that any change
  will be made in the future, for the use of tincture lines is now very
  rapidly being discarded by all good heraldic artists in this country.
  With the reversion to older and better forms and methods these hatchings
  become an anachronism, and save that sable is represented by solid black
  they will probably be unused and forgotten before very long.</p>

  <p>The plain, simple names of colours, such as red and green, seemed so
  unpoetical and unostentatious to the heralds and poets of the Middle
  Ages, that they substituted for gold, topaz; for silver, pearl or
  "meergries"; for red, ruby; for blue, sapphire; for green, emerald; and
  for black, diamond or "zobel" (sable, the animal, whence the word
  "sable"). Let the following blazonment from the grant of arms to Mödling
  bei Wien in 1458 serve as example of the same: "Mit namen ain Schilt
  gleich getailt in fasse, des ober und maister tail von Rubin auch mit
  ainer fasse von Berlein, der under thail von grunt des Schilts von
  Schmaragaden, darinneain Pantel von Silber in
  Rampannt"&mdash;(<i>lit.</i> "Namely, a shield equally divided in fess,
  the upper and greater part of ruby, also with a fess of pearl, the under
  part of the field of the shield of emerald, therein a panther of silver,
  rampant"); that is, "Per fess gules and vert, in chief a fess argent, in
  base a panther rampant of the last."</p>

  <p>Even the planets, and, as abbreviations, their astronomical signs, are
  occasionally employed: thus, the <i>sun</i> for gold, the <i>moon</i> for
  silver, <i>Mars</i> for red, <i>Jupiter</i> for blue, <i>Venus</i> for
  green, <i>Saturn</i> for black, and <i>Mercury</i> for purple. This
  aberration of intellect on the part of mediæval heraldic writers, for it
  really amounted to little more, had very little, if indeed it had any,
  English official recognition. No one dreams of using such blazon at the
  present time, and it might have been entirely disregarded were it not
  that Guillim sanctions its use; and he being the high priest of English
  armory to so many, his example has given the system a certain currency. I
  am not myself aware of any instance of the use of these terms in an
  English patent of arms.</p>

  <p>The furs known to heraldry are now many, but originally they were only
  two, "ermine" and "vair." Ermine, as every one knows, is of <!-- Page 78
  --><span class="pagenum" title="100.png"><a
  name="page78"></a>{78}</span>white covered with black spots, intended to
  represent the tails of the animal. From ermine has been evolved the
  following variations, viz. ermines, erminois, pean, and erminites.
  "Ermines" is a black field with white ermine spots (the French term for
  this is <i>contre-hermin</i>, the German, <i>gegen-hermelin</i>). A gold
  background with black ermine spots is styled erminois, and pean is a
  black ground with gold ermine spots. Planché mentions still another, as
  does Parker in his "Glossary of Heraldry," namely, "erminites," which is
  supposed to be white, with black ermine spots and a red hair on each side
  of the spot. I believe there is no instance known of any such fur in
  British armory. It is not mentioned in Ströhl's "Heraldic Atlas," nor can
  I find any foreign instance, so that who invented it, or for what purpose
  it was invented, I cannot say; and I think it should be relegated, with
  abatements and the <i>seize quartiers</i> of Jesus Christ, to the
  category of the silly inventions of former heraldic writers, not of
  former heralds, for I know of no official act which has recognised the
  existence of erminites. The German term for erminois is
  <i>gold-hermelin</i>, but there are no distinctive terms either in French
  or German heraldry for the other varieties. Thus, erminois would be in
  French blazon: d'or, semé d'hermines de sable; pean would be de sable,
  semé d'hermines d'or. Though ermine is always nowadays represented upon a
  white background, it was sometimes depicted with black ermine spots upon
  a field of silver, as in the case of some of the stall plates of the
  Knights of the Garter in St. George's Chapel at Windsor. Ermine spots are
  frequently to be found as charges. For instance, in the well-known coat
  of Kay, which is: "Argent, three ermine spots in bend between two
  bendlets sable, the whole between as many crescents azure." As charges
  two ermine spots figure upon the arms recently granted to Sir Francis
  Laking, Bart., G.C.V.O. The ermine spot has also sometimes been used in
  British armory as the difference mark granted under a Royal Licence to
  assume name and arms when it is necessary to indicate the absence of
  blood relationship. Other instances of the use of an ermine spot as a
  charge are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Or, on two bars azure, as many barrulets dancetté argent, a chief
  indented of the second charged with an ermine spot or (Sawbridge).</p>

  <p>Argent, a chevron between three crows sable, in each beak an ermine
  spot (Lloyd, Bishop of St. Asaph, 1680; Lichfield, 1692; and Worcester,
  1700-17).</p>

  <p>Argent, a fess gules between three ermine spots sable
  (Kilvington).</p>

  <p>Argent, two bars sable, spotted ermine, in chief a lion passant gules
  (Hill, co. Wexford).</p>

  <p>The earliest form in which ermine was depicted shows a nearer approach
  to the reality of the black tail, inasmuch as the spots above the tail to
  which we are now accustomed are a modern variant. <!-- Page 79 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="101.png"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span></p>

  <p>When a bend is ermine, the spots (like all other charges placed upon a
  bend) must be bendwise; but on a chevron, saltire, &amp;c., they are
  drawn upright.</p>

  <p>The other variety of fur is "vair." This originated from the fur of a
  kind of squirrel (the ver or vair, differently spelt; Latin
  <i>varus</i>), which was much used for the lining of cloaks. The animal
  was bluey-grey upon the back and white underneath, and the whole skin was
  used. It will be readily seen that by sewing a number of these skins
  together a result is obtained of a series of cup-shaped figures,
  alternating bluey-grey and white, and this is well shown in Fig. 28,
  which shows the effigy upon the tomb of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of
  Anjou, where the lining of vair to his cloak is plainly to be seen.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The word seems to have been used independently of heraldry for fur,
  and the following curious error, which is pointed out in Parker's
  "Glossary of the Terms used in Heraldry," may be noted in passing. The
  familiar fairy tale of Cinderella was brought to us from the French, and
  the slippers made of this costly fur, written, probably, <i>verre</i> for
  <i>vairé</i>, were erroneously translated "glass" slippers. This was, of
  course, an impossible material, but the error has always been repeated in
  the nursery tale-books.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the oldest records vair is represented by means of straight
  horizontal lines alternating with horizontal wavy or nebuly lines (see
  Fig. 37), but the cup-shaped divisions therefrom resulting having passed
  through various intermediate forms (see Fig. 38), have now been
  stereotyped into a fixed geometrical pattern, formed of rows of
  ear-shaped shields of alternate colours and alternately reversed, so
  depicted that each reversed shield fits into the space left by those on
  either side which are not reversed (see Fig. 39, <i>k</i>). The
  accompanying illustration will show plainly what is intended. In some of
  the older designs it was similar to that shown in the arms of the Earl
  Ferrers, Earl of Derby, 1254-65, the sketch (Fig. 38) being taken from
  almost contemporary stained glass in Dorchester Church, Oxon.; whilst
  sometimes the <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum" title="102.png"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>division lines are drawn, after the same
  manner, as <i>nebuly</i>. There does not seem to have been any fixed
  proportion for the number of rows of vair, as Fig. 40 shows the arms of
  the same Earl as represented upon his seal. The palpable pun upon the
  name which a shield vairé supplied no doubt affords the origin of the
  arms of Ferrers. Some families of the name at a later date adopted the
  horseshoes, which are to be found upon many Farrer and Ferrers shields,
  the popular assumption being that they are a reference to the "farrier"
  from whom some would derive the surname. Woodward, however, states that a
  horseshoe being the badge of the Marshalls, horseshoes were assumed as
  <i>armes parlantes</i> by their descendants the Ferrers, who appear to
  have borne: Sable, six horseshoes argent. As a matter of fact the only
  one of that family who bore the horseshoes seems to have been William de
  Ferrers, Earl of Derby (<i>d.</i> 1254), as will be seen from the arms as
  on his seal (Fig. 41). <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum" title="105.png"
  ><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>His wife was Sybilla, daughter of
  William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke. His son reverted to the plain shield
  of vairé, or, and gules. The arms of the Ferrers family at a later date
  are found to be: Gules, seven mascles conjoined or, in which form they
  are still borne by Ferrers of Baddesley Clinton; but whether the mascles
  are corruptions of the horseshoes, or whether (as seems infinitely more
  probable) they are merely a corrupted form of the vairé, or, and gules,
  it is difficult to say. Personally I rather doubt whether any Ferrers
  ever used the arms: Argent, six horseshoes sable.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The early manner of depicting vair is still occasionally met with in
  foreign heraldry, where it is blazoned as Vair ondé or Vair ancien. The
  family of <span class="sc">Margens</span> in Spain bears: Vair ondé, on a
  bend gules three griffins or; and <span class="sc">Tarragone</span> of
  Spain: Vair ondé, or and gules. German heraldry seems to distinguish
  between <i>wolkenfeh</i> (cloud vair) and <i>wogenfeh</i> (wave vair; see
  Fig. 39, <i>n</i>). The former is equivalent to vair ancient, the latter
  to vair en point.</p>

  <p>The verbal blazon of vair nearly always commences with the metal, but
  in the arrangement of the panes there is a difference between French and
  English usage. In the former the white panes are generally (and one
  thinks more correctly) represented as forming the first, or upper, line;
  in British heraldry the reverse is more usually the case. It is usual to
  depict the white panes of ordinary vair with white rather than silver,
  though the use of the latter cannot be said to be incorrect, there being
  precedents in favour of that form. When an ordinary is of vair or vairy,
  the rows of vair may be depicted either horizontally or following the
  direction of the ordinary. There are accepted precedents for both
  methods.</p>

  <p>Vair is always blue and white, but the same subdivision of the field
  is frequently found in other colours; and when this is the case, it is
  termed vairy of such and such colours. When it is vairy, it is usually of
  a colour and metal, as in the case of Ferrers, Earls of Derby, above
  referred to; though a fur is sometimes found to take the place of one or
  other, as in the arms of Gresley, which are: "Vairé gules and ermine." I
  know of no instance where vairé is found of either two metals or of two
  colours, nor at the same time do I know of any rule against such a
  combination. Probably it will be time enough to discuss the contingency
  when an instance comes to light. Gerard Leigh mentions vair of three or
  more tinctures, but instances are very rare. Parker, in his "Glossary,"
  refers to the coat of Roger Holthouse, which he blazons: "Vairy argent,
  azure, gules, and or, en point."</p>

  <p>The <i>Vair</i> of commerce was formerly of three sizes, and the
  distinction is continued in foreign armory. The middle or ordinary <!--
  Page 82 --><span class="pagenum" title="106.png"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>size is known as <i>Vair</i>; a smaller size
  as <i>Menu-vair</i> (whence our word "miniver"); the largest as
  <i>Beffroi</i> or <i>Gros vair</i>, a term which is used in armory when
  there are less than four rows. The word <i>Beffroi</i> is evidently
  derived from the bell-like shape of the <i>vair</i>, the word
  <i>Beffroi</i> being anciently used in the sense of the alarm-bell of a
  town. In French armory, <i>Beffroi</i> should consist of three horizontal
  rows; <i>Vair</i>, of four; <i>Menu-vair</i>, of six. This rule is not
  strictly observed, but in French blazon if the rows are more than four it
  is usual to specify the number; thus Varroux bears: <i>de Vair de cinq
  traits</i>. <i>Menu-vair</i> is still the blazon of some families; <span
  class="sc">Banville de Trutemne</span> bears: <i>de Menu-vair de six
  tires</i>; the Barons van <span class="sc">Houthem</span> bore: <i>de
  Menu-vair, au franc quartier de gueules chargé de trois maillets
  d'or</i>. In British armory the foregoing distinctions are unknown, and
  <i>Vair</i> is only of one size, that being at the discretion of the
  artist.</p>

  <p>When the Vair is so arranged that in two horizontal rows taken
  together, either the points or the bases of two panes of the same
  tincture are in apposition, the fur is known as <span class="sc">Counter
  Vair (Contre Vair)</span> (see Fig. 39, <i>l</i>). Another variation, but
  an infrequent one, is termed <span class="sc">Vair in Pale</span>, known
  in German heraldry as <i>Pfahlfeh</i> (<i>Vair appointé</i> or <i>Vair en
  pal</i>; but if of other colours than the usual ones, <i>Vairé en
  pal</i>). In this all panes of the same colour are arranged in vertical,
  or palar, rows (Fig. 39, <i>m</i>). German heraldry apparently
  distinguishes between this and <i>Stürzpfahlfeh</i>, or <i>reversed</i>
  vair in pale. <span class="sc">Vair in Bend</span> (or in bend-sinister)
  is occasionally met with in foreign coats; thus <span
  class="sc">Mignianelli</span> in Italy bears: <i>Vairé d'or et d'azur en
  bande</i>; while <i>Vairé en barre</i> (that is, in bend-sinister)
  <i>d'or et de sable</i> is the coat of <span class="sc">Pichon</span> of
  Geneva.</p>

  <p>"Vair en pointe" is a term applied by Nisbet to an arrangement by
  which the azure shield pointing downwards has beneath it an argent shield
  pointing downwards, and <i>vice versâ</i>, by which method the resulting
  effect is as shown in Fig. 39, <i>n</i>. The German term for this is
  <i>Wogenfeh</i>, or wave vair. Fig. 39, <i>o</i>, shows a purely German
  variety&mdash;<i>Wechselfeh</i>, or alternate vair; and Fig. 39,
  <i>p</i>, which is equivalent to the English vairé of four colours, is
  known in German armory as <i>Buntfeh, i.e.</i> gay-coloured or checked
  vair.</p>

  <p>Ordinary vair in German heraldry is known as <i>Eisenhüt-feh</i>, or
  iron hat vair. On account of its similarity, when drawn, to the old iron
  hat of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (see Fig. 42), this skin
  has received the name of <i>Eisenhutlein</i> (little iron hat) from
  German heraldic students, a name which later gave rise to many incorrect
  interpretations. An old charter in the archives of the chapter-house of
  Lilienfield, in Lower Austria, under the seal (Fig. 43) of one Chimrad
  Pellifex, 1329, proves that at that time vair was so styled. The name of
  Pellifex (in <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum" title="107.png"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>German <i>Wildwerker</i>, a worker in skins,
  or furrier) is expressed in a punning or canting form on the dexter side
  of the shield. This Conrad the Furrier was Burgomaster of Vienna
  1340-43.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of British and foreign families bear <i>Vair</i>
  only; such are <span class="sc">Ferrers</span> and <span
  class="sc">Gresley</span>, above mentioned; <span
  class="sc">Varano</span>, Dukes de <span class="sc">Camerino</span>;
  <span class="sc">Vaire</span> and <span class="sc">Vairière</span>, in

  (Brittany); <span class="sc">Varenchon</span> (Savoy); <span
  class="sc">Soldanieri</span> (Florence). <i>Counter vair</i> is borne by
  <span class="sc">Loffredo</span> of Naples; by <span
  class="sc">Bouchage</span>, <span class="sc">Du Plessis Angers</span>,
  and <span class="sc">Brotin</span>, of France. <span

  <p>Mr. Woodward, in his "Treatise on Heraldry," writes: "Two curious
  forms of Vair occasionally met with in Italian or French coats are known
  as <i>Plumeté</i> and <i>Papelonné</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Plumeté</i> the field is apparently covered with feathers.
  <i>Plumeté d'argent et d'azur</i> is the coat of Ceba (note that these
  are the tinctures of <i>Vair</i>); <span class="sc">Soldonieri</span> of
  Udine, <i>Plumeté au natural</i> (but the <span
  class="sc">Soldonieri</span> of Florence bore: <i>Vairé argent and
  sable</i> with <i>a bordure chequy or and azure</i>); <span
  class="sc">Tenremonde</span> of Brabant: <i>Plumeté or and sable</i>. In
  the arms of the <span class="sc">Scaltenighi</span> of Padua, the <span
  class="sc">Benzoni</span> of Milan, the <span class="sc">Giolfini</span>,
  <span class="sc">Catanei</span>, and <span class="sc">Nuvoloni</span> of
  Verona, each feather of the <i>plumeté</i> is said to be charged with an
  ermine spot sable.</p>

  <p>The bearing of <span class="sc">Papelonné</span> is more frequently
  found; in it the field is covered with what appear to be scales, the
  heraldic term <i>papelonné</i> being derived from a supposed resemblance
  of these scales to the wings of butterflies; for example the coat of
  <span class="sc">Monti</span>: <i>Gules, papelonné argent</i>. <span
  class="sc">Donzel</span> at Besançon bears: Papelonné d'or et de sable.
  It is worthy of note that Donzé of Lorraine used: Gules, three bars wavy
  or. The <span class="sc">Franconis</span> of Lausanne are said to bear:
  <i>de Gueules papelonné d'argent</i>, and on <i>a chief of the last a
  rose of the first</i>, but the coat is otherwise blazoned: <i>Vaire gules
  and or</i>, &amp;c. The coat of <span class="sc">Arquinvilliers</span>,
  or <span class="sc">Hargenvilliers</span>, in Picardy, of <i>d'Hermine
  papelonné de <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum" title="108.png"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>gueules</i> (not being understood, this has
  been blazoned "<i>semé of caltraps</i>"). So also the coat of <span
  class="sc">Chemillé</span> appears in French books of blazon
  indifferently as: <i>d'Or papelonné de gueules</i>: and <i>d'Or semé de
  chausse-trapes de gueules</i>. <span class="sc">Guétteville de
  Guénonville</span> is said to bear: <i>d'Argent semé de chausse-trapes de
  sable</i>, but it is more probable that this is simply <i>d'Argent
  papelonné de sable</i>. The <span class="sc">Barisoni</span> of Padua
  bear: <i>Or, a bend of scales, bendwise argent, on each scale an ermine
  spot sable, the bend bordered sable</i>. The <span
  class="sc">Alberici</span> of Bologna bear: <i>Papelonné of seven rows,
  four of argent, three of or</i>; but the <span class="sc">Alberghi</span>
  of the same city: <i>Papelonné of six rows, three of argent, as many of
  gules</i>. The connection with <i>vairé</i> is much clearer in the latter
  than in the former. <span class="sc">Cambi</span> (called <span
  class="sc">Figliambuchi</span>), at Florence, carried: <i>d'Argent,
  papelonné de gueules</i>; <span class="sc">Monti</span> of Florence and
  Sicily, and <span class="sc">Ronquerolles</span> of France the
  reverse.</p>

  <p>No one who is familiar with the licence given to themselves by
  armorial painters and sculptors in Italy, who were often quite ignorant
  of the meaning of the blazons they depicted, will doubt for a moment the
  statement that Papelonné was originally a corruption from or perhaps is
  simply ill-drawn Vair."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Potent</span>, and its less common variant <span
  class="sc">Counter Potent</span>, are usually ranked in British heraldic
  works as separate furs. This has arisen from the writers being ignorant
  that in early times <i>Vair</i> was frequently depicted in the form now
  known as <i>Potent</i> (see Fig. 39, <i>q</i>). (By many heraldic writers
  the ordinary <i>Potent</i> is styled <i>Potent-counter-potent</i>. When
  drawn in the ordinary way, <i>Potent</i> alone suffices.) An example of
  <i>Vair</i> in the form now known as Potent is afforded by the seal of
  <span class="sc">Jeanne de Flandre</span>, wife of <span
  class="sc">Enguerrand IV.</span> (De Courcy); here the well-known arms of
  <span class="sc">Courcy</span>, <i>Barry of six vair and gules</i>, are
  depicted as if the bars of vair were composed of bars of <i>potent</i>
  (<span class="sc">Vrée</span>, <i>Généalogie des Comtes de Flandre</i>).
  In a <i>Roll of Arms of the time of Edward I.</i> the <i>Vair</i>
  resembles <i>Potent</i> (-counter-potent), which <span class="sc">Dr.
  Perceval</span> erroneously terms an "invention of later date." The name
  and the differentiation may be, but not the fact. In the First Nobility
  Roll of the year 1297, the arms of No. 8, <span class="sc">Robert de
  Bruis</span>, Baron of Brecknock, are: Barry of six, Vaire ermine and
  gules, and azure. Here the vair is potent; so is it also in No. 19, where
  the coat of <span class="sc">Ingelram de Ghisnes</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Gynes</span>, is: Gules, a chief vair. The same coat is thus
  drawn in the Second Nobility Roll, 1299, No. 57. <span
  class="sc">Potent</span>, like its original <i>Vair</i>, is always of
  <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>, unless other tinctures are specified in
  the blazon. The name <i>Potent</i> is the old English word for a crutch
  or walking-staff. Chaucer, in his description of "Elde" (<i>i.e.</i> old
  age) writes:</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"So olde she was, that she ne went</p>
      <p>A fote, but it were by potent."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum" title="109.png"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span></p>

  <p>And though a potent is a heraldic charge, and a cross potent a
  well-known variety of that ordinary, "potent" is usually intended to
  indicate the fur of blue and white as in Fig. 39, <i>q</i>. It is not of
  frequent usage, but it undoubtedly has an accepted place in British
  armory, as also has "counter-potent," which, following the same rules as
  counter-vair, results in a field as Fig. 39, <i>r</i>. The German terms
  for Potent and counter-potent are respectively <i>Sturzkrückenfeh</i> and
  <i>gegensturzkrückenfeh</i> German heraldry has evolved yet another
  variant of Potent, viz. <i>Verschobenes Gegensturzkrückenfeh</i>
  (<i>i.e.</i> displaced potent-counter-potent), as in Fig. 39, <i>s</i>.
  There is still yet another German heraldic fur which is quite unknown in
  British armory. This is called <i>Kursch</i>, otherwise "Vair bellies,"
  and is usually shown to be hairy and represented brown. Possibly this is
  the same as the <i>Plumeté</i> to which Mr. Woodward refers.</p>

  <p>Some heraldic writers also speak of <i>varry</i> as meaning the pieces
  of which the vair is composed; they also use the terms <i>vairy cuppy</i>
  and <i>vairy tassy</i> for <i>potent-counter-potent</i>, perhaps from the
  drawings in some instances resembling <i>cups</i>; that is a possible
  meaning of <i>tassa</i>. It may be said that all these variations of the
  ancient <i>vair</i> arise from mere accident (generally bad drawing),
  supplemented by over refinement on the part of the heraldic writers who
  have described them. This generalisation may be extended in its
  application from vair to many other heraldic matters. To all intents and
  purposes British heraldry now or hitherto has only known vair and
  potent.</p>

  <p>One of the earliest rules one learns in the study of armory is that
  colour cannot be placed upon colour, nor metal upon metal. Now this is a
  definite rule which must practically always be rigidly observed. Many
  writers have gone so far as to say that the only case of an infraction of
  this rule will be found in the arms of Jerusalem: Argent, a cross potent
  between four crosslets or. This was a favourite windmill at which the
  late Dr. Woodward tilted vigorously, and in the appendix to his "Treatise
  on Heraldry" he enumerates some twenty-six instances of the violation of
  the rule. The whole of the instances he quoted, however, are taken from
  Continental armory, in which these exceptions&mdash;for even on the
  Continent such <i>armes fausses</i> are noticeable exceptions&mdash;occur
  much more frequently than in this country. Nevertheless such exceptions
  <i>do</i> occur in British armory, and the following instances of
  well-known coats which break the rule may be quoted.</p>

  <p>The arms of Lloyd of Ffos-y-Bleiddied, co. Cardigan, and Danyrallt,
  co. Carmarthen, are: "Sable, a spearhead imbrued proper between three
  scaling-ladders argent, on a chief <i>gules</i> a castle of the second."
  Burke, in his "General Armory," says this coat of arms was granted to
  Cadifor ap Dyfnwal, ninth in descent from Roderick the Great, Prince of
  Wales, by his cousin the great Lord Rhys, for taking the castle of <!--
  Page 86 --><span class="pagenum" title="110.png"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>Cardigan by escalade from the Earl of Clare
  and the Flemings in 1164. Another instance is a coat of Meredith recorded
  in Ulster's Office and now inherited by the Hon. Richard Edmund Meredith,
  a judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Ireland and a Judicial
  Commissioner of the Irish Land Commission. These arms are: "Gules, on a
  chevron sable, between three goats' heads erased, as many trefoils or."
  An instance of comparatively recent date will be found in the grant of
  the arms of Thackeray. A little careful research, no doubt, would produce
  a large number of English instances, but one is bound to admit the
  possibility that the great bulk of these cases may really be instances of
  augmentation.</p>

  <p>Furs may be placed upon either metal or colour, as may also any charge
  which is termed proper. German heralds describe furs and natural colours
  as amphibious. It is perfectly legitimate to place fur upon fur, and
  though not often found, numbers of examples can be quoted; probably one
  will suffice. The arms of Richardson are: Sable, two hawks belled or, on
  a chief indented ermine, a pale ermines, and three lions' heads
  counterchanged. It is also correct to place ermine upon argent. But such
  coats are not very frequently found, and it is usual in designing a coat
  to endeavour to arrange that the fur shall be treated as metal or colour
  according to what may be its background. The reason for this is obvious.
  It is correct, though unusual, for a charge which is blazoned proper, and
  yet depicted in a recognised heraldic colour, to be placed upon colour;
  and where such cases occur, care should be taken that the charges are
  blazoned proper. A charge composed of more than one tincture, that is, of
  a metal and colour, may be placed upon a field of either; for example the
  well-known coat of Stewart, which is: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent;
  other examples being: Per pale ermine and azure, a fess wavy gules
  (Broadbent); and: Azure, a lion rampant argent, debruised by a fess per
  pale of the second and gules (Walsh); but in such coats it will usually
  be found that the first tincture of the composite charge should be in
  opposition to the field upon which it is superimposed. For instance, the
  arms of Stewart are: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent, and to blazon or
  depict them with a fess chequy argent and azure would be incorrect. When
  an ordinary is charged upon both metal and colour, it would be quite
  correct for it to be of either metal, colour, or fur, and in such cases
  it has never been considered either exceptional or an infraction of the
  rule that colour must not be placed upon colour, nor metal upon metal.
  There is one point, however, which is one of these little points one has
  to learn from actual experience, and which I believe has never yet been
  quoted in any handbook of heraldry, and that is, that this rule must be
  thrown overboard with regard to <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum" title="111.png"
  ><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>crests and supporters. I cannot call to
  mind an instance of colour upon colour, but a gold collar around the neck
  of an argent crest will constantly be met with. The sinister supporter of
  the Royal achievement is a case in point, and this rule, which forbids
  colour upon colour, and metal upon metal, only holds with regard to
  supporters and crests when the crest or supporter itself is treated as a
  field and <i>charged with</i> one or more objects. The Royal labels, as
  already stated, appear to be a standing infraction of the rule if white
  and argent are to be heraldically treated as identical. The rule is also
  disregarded entirely as regards augmentations and Scottish cadency
  bordures.</p>

  <p>So long as the field is party, that is, divided into an equal number
  of pieces (for example, paly, barruly, or bendy, or party per bend or per
  chevron), it may be composed of two metals or two colours, because the
  pieces all being equal, and of equal number, they all are parts of the
  field lying in the same plane, none being charges.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the subject of the field, one must not omit to mention
  certain exceptions which hardly fall within any of the before-mentioned
  categories. One of these can only be described by the word "landscape."
  It is not uncommon in British armory, though I know of but one instance
  where the actual field itself needs to be so described. This is the coat
  of the family of Franco, the paternal ancestors of Sir Massey Lopes,
  Bart., and Lord Ludlow. The name was changed from Franco to Lopes by
  Royal Licence dated the 4th of May 1831. Whether this coat of arms
  originated in an English grant, or whether the English grant of it
  amounts to no more than an attempt at the registration of a previously
  existing or greatly similar foreign coat of arms for the name of Franco,
  I am unaware, but the coat certainly is blazoned: "In a landscape field,
  a fountain, therefrom issuing a palm-tree all proper."</p>

  <p>But landscape has very extensively been made use of in the
  augmentations which were granted at the end of the eighteenth and
  beginning of the nineteenth centuries. In these cases the augmentation
  very generally consisted of a chief and thereon a representation either
  of some fort or ship or action, and though the field of the augmentation
  is officially blazoned argent in nearly every case, there is no doubt the
  artist was permitted, and perhaps intended, to depict clouds and other
  "atmosphere" to add to the verisimilitude of the picture. These
  augmentations will be more especially considered in a later chapter, but
  here one may perhaps be permitted to remark, that execrable as we now
  consider such landscape heraldry, it ought not to be condemned in the
  wholesale manner in which it has been, because it was typical of the over
  elaboration to be found in all art and all artistic ideas of the period
  in which we find it originating. Heraldry and heraldic art have <!-- Page
  88 --><span class="pagenum" title="112.png"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>always been a mirror of the artistic ideas
  prevalent at equivalent periods, and unless heraldry is to be wholly
  relegated to consideration as a dead subject, it is an anachronism to
  depict an action the date of which is well known (and which date it is
  desired to advertise and not conceal) in a method of art belonging to a
  different period. In family arms the case is different, as with those the
  idea apparently is always the concealment of the date of nobility.</p>

  <p>The "landscape" variety of heraldry is more common in Germany than
  with us, and Ströhl writes: "Of very little heraldic worth are the old
  house and home signs as they were used by landed proprietors, tradesmen,
  and artisans or workmen, as indicative of their possessions, wares, or
  productions. These signs, originally simply outline pictures, were later
  introduced into heraldic soil, inasmuch as bourgeois families raised to
  the nobility adopted their house signs as heraldic charges upon their
  shields."</p>

  <p>There are also many coats of arms which run: "In base, a
  representation of water proper," and one of the best instances of this
  will be found in the arms of Oxford, though for the sake of preserving
  the pun the coat in this case is blazoned: "Argent, an ox gules passing
  over a ford proper." Similar instances occur in the arms of Renfrew,
  Queensferry, Leith, Ryde, and scores of other towns. It has always been
  considered permissible to represent these either by an attempt to depict
  natural water, or else in the ancient heraldic way of representing water,
  namely "barry wavy argent and azure." There are many other coats of arms
  which are of a similar character though specifically blazoned "barry wavy
  argent and azure." Now this representation of water in base can hardly be
  properly said to be a charge, but perhaps it might be dismissed as such
  were it not that one coat of arms exists in Scotland, the whole of the
  field of which is simply a representation of water. Unfortunately this
  coat of arms has never been matriculated in Lyon Register or received
  official sanction; but there is no doubt of its ancient usage, and were
  it to be now matriculated in conformity with the Act of 1672, there is
  very little doubt that the ancient characteristic would be retained. The
  arms are those of the town of Inveraray in Argyllshire, and the blazon of
  the coat, according to the form it is depicted upon the Corporate seal,
  would be for the field: "The sea proper, therein a net suspended from the
  dexter chief and the sinister fess points to the base; and entangled in
  its meshes five herrings," which is about the most remarkable coat of
  arms I have ever come across.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a "field," or portion of a field, will be found to be a
  representation of masonry. This may be either proper or of some metal or
  colour. The arms of the city of Bath are: "Party per fesse <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum" title="113.png"><a
  name="page89"></a>{89}</span>embattled azure and argent, the base
  masonry, in chief two bars wavy of the second; over all, a sword in pale
  gules, hilt and pommel or." The arms of Reynell are: "Argent, masoned
  sable, a chief indented of the second."</p>

<h5>SEME</h5>

  <p>The use of the term "semé" must be considered before we leave the
  subject of the field. It simply means "powdered with" or "strewed with"
  any objects, the number of the latter being unlimited, the purpose being
  to evenly distribute them over the shield. In depicting anything semé,
  care is usually taken that some of the charges (with which the field is
  semé) shall be partly defaced by the edges of the shield, or the ordinary
  upon which they are charged, or by the superior charge itself, to
  indicate that the field is not charged with a specific number of
  objects.</p>

  <p>There are certain special terms which may be noted. A field or charge
  semé of fleurs-de-lis is termed "semé-de-lis," but if semé of bezants it
  is bezanté, and is termed platé if semé of plates.</p>

  <p>A field semé of billets is billetty or billetté, and when semé of
  cross crosslets it is termed crusilly. A field or charge semé of drops is
  termed goutté or gutty.</p>

  <p>Instances of coats of which the field is semé will be found in the
  arms of De la Warr (see Fig. 44), which are: Gules, crusilly, and a lion
  rampant argent; Beaumont (see Fig. 45): Azure, semé-de-lis and a lion
  rampant or; and Umfraville (see Fig. 46): Gules, semé of crosses flory,
  and a cinquefoil or.</p>

  <p>The goutte or drop occasionally figures (in a specified number) as a
  charge; but such cases are rare, its more frequent use being to show <!--
  Page 90 --><span class="pagenum" title="114.png"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>a field semé. British heraldry alone has
  evolved separate names for the different colours, all other nations
  simply using the term "goutté" or "gutté," and specifying the colour. The
  terms we have adopted are as follows: For drops of gold, "gutté-d'or";
  silver, "gutté-d'eau"; for gules, "gutté-de-sang"; azure,
  "gutté-de-larmes"; vert, "gutté-d'huile"; and sable, "gutté-de-poix."</p>

  <p>The term semé must not be confused with diapering, for whilst the
  objects with which a field is semé are an integral part of the arms,
  diapering is a purely artistic and optional matter.</p>

<h5>DIAPERING</h5>

  <p>The diapering of armorial emblazonments is a matter with which the
  <i>Science</i> of armory has no concern. Diaper never forms any part of
  the blazon, and is never officially noticed, being considered, and very
  properly allowed to remain, a purely artistic detail. From the artistic
  point of view it has some importance, as in many of the earliest
  instances of handicraft in which armorial decoration appears, very
  elaborate diapering is introduced. The frequency with which diapering is
  met with in armorial handicraft is strangely at variance with its absence
  in heraldic paintings of the same periods, a point which may perhaps be
  urged upon the attention of some of the heraldic artists of the present
  day, who would rather seem to have failed to grasp the true purpose and
  origin and perhaps also the use of diaper. In stained glass and enamel
  work, where the use of diaper is most frequently met with, it was
  introduced for the express purpose of catching and breaking up the light,
  the result of which was to give an enormously increased effect of
  brilliance to the large and otherwise flat surfaces. These tricks of
  their art and craft the old handicraftsmen were past masters in the use
  of. But no such purpose could be served in a small painting upon vellum.
  For this reason early heraldic emblazonments are seldom if ever found to
  have been diapered. With the rise of heraldic engraving amongst the
  "little masters" of German art, the opportunity left to their hands by
  the absence of colour naturally led to the renewed use of diaper to avoid
  the appearance of blanks in their work. The use of diaper at the present
  day needs to be the result of careful study and thought, and its
  haphazard employment is not recommended.</p>

  <p>If, as Woodward states (an assertion one is rather inclined to doubt),
  there are some cases abroad in which the constant use of diapering has
  been stereotyped into an integral part of the arms, these cases must be
  exceedingly few in number, and they certainly have no counterpart in the
  armory of this country. Where for artistic reasons <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="115.png"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>diapering
  is employed, care must always be taken that the decorative form employed
  cannot be mistaken for a field either charged or semé.</p>

<h5>PARTITION LINES</h5>

  <p>If there is one subject which the ordinary text-books of armory treat
  in the manner of classification adapted to an essay on natural history or
  grammar, with its attendant rigidity of rule, it is the subject of
  partition lines; and yet the whole subject is more in the nature of a set
  of explanations which must each be learned on its own merits. The usual
  lines of partition are themselves well enough known; and it is hardly
  necessary to elaborate the different variations at any great length. They
  may, however, be enumerated as follows: Engrailed, embattled, indented,
  invecked or invected, wavy or undy, nebuly, dancetté, raguly, potenté,
  dovetailed, and urdy. These are the lines which are recognised by most
  modern heraldic text-books and generally recapitulated; but we shall have
  occasion later to refer to others which are very well known, though
  apparently they have never been included in the classification of
  partition lines (Fig. 47). <i>Engrailed</i>, as every one knows, is
  formed by a continuous and concurrent series of small semicircles
  conjoined each to each, the sharp points formed by the conjunction of the
  two arcs being placed <i>outwards</i>. This partition line may be
  employed for the rectilinear charges known as "ordinaries" or
  "sub-ordinaries." In the bend, pale, pile, cross, chief, and fess, when
  these are described as engrailed the enclosing lines of the ordinary,
  other than the edges of the shield, are all composed of these small
  semicircles with the points turned <i>outwards</i>, and the word
  "outwards" must be construed as pointing away from the centre of the
  ordinary when it is depicted. In the case of a chief the points are
  turned downwards, but it is rather difficult to describe the use of the
  term when used as a partition line of the field. The only instance I can
  call to mind where it is so employed is the case of Baird of Ury, the
  arms of this family being: Per pale engrailed gules and or, a boar
  passant counterchanged. In this instance the points are turned towards
  the sinister side of the shield, which would seem to be correct, as,
  there being no ordinary, they must be outwards from the most important
  position affected, which in this case undoubtedly is the dexter side of
  the shield. In the same way "per fess engrailed" would be presumably
  depicted with the points outwards from the chief line of the shield, that
  is, they would point downwards; and I should imagine that in "per bend
  engrailed" the points of the semicircles would again be placed inclined
  towards the dexter base of the shield, but I may be wrong in these two
  latter cases, for they are only supposition. This <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="116.png"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>point,
  however, which puzzled me much in depicting the arms of Baird of Ury, I
  could find explained in no text-book upon the subject.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    47.</span>&mdash;Lines of Partition.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The term <i>invected</i> or <i>invecked</i> is the precise opposite of
  engrailed. It is similarly composed of small semicircles, but the points
  are turned inwards instead of outwards, so that it is no more than the
  exact reverse of engrailed, and all the regulations concerning the one
  need to be observed concerning the other, with the proviso that they are
  reversed. <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum" title="117.png"><a
  name="page93"></a>{93}</span></p>

  <p>The partition line <i>embattled</i> has certain peculiarities of its
  own. When dividing the field there can be no difficulty about it,
  inasmuch as the crenellations are equally inwards and outwards from any
  point, and it should be noted that the term "crenellé" is almost as often
  used as "embattled." When, however, the term describes an ordinary,
  certain points have to be borne in mind. The fess or the bar embattled is
  drawn with the crenellations <i>on the upper side</i> only, the under
  edge being plain unless the ordinary is described both as "embattled and
  counter-embattled." Similarly a chevron is only crenellated on the upper
  edge unless it is described as both embattled and counter-embattled, but
  a pale embattled is crenellated on both edges as is the cross or saltire.
  Strictly speaking, a bend embattled is crenellated upon the upper edge
  only, though with regard to this ordinary there is much laxity of
  practice. I have never come across a pile embattled; but it would
  naturally be embattled on both edges. Some writers make a distinction
  between embattled and bretessed, giving to the former term the meaning
  that the embattlements on the one side are opposed to the indentations on
  the other, and using the term bretessed to signify that embattlements are
  opposite embattlements and indentations opposite indentations. I am
  doubtful as to the accuracy of this distinction, because the French term
  bretessé means only counter-embattled.</p>

  <p>The terms <i>indented</i> and <i>dancetté</i> need to be considered
  together, because they differ very little, and only in the fact that
  whilst indented may be drawn with any number of teeth, dancetté is drawn
  with a limited number, which is usually three complete teeth in the width
  of the field. But it should be observed that this rule is not so hard and
  fast that the necessity of artistic depicting may not modify it slightly.
  An ordinary which is indented would follow much the same rules as an
  ordinary which was engrailed, except that the teeth are made by small
  straight lines for the indentations instead of by small semicircles, and
  instances can doubtless be found of all the ordinaries qualified by the
  term indented. Dancetté, however, does not lend itself so readily to
  general application, and is usually to be found applied to either a fess
  or chief, or occasionally a bend. In the case of a fess dancetté the
  indentations on the top and bottom lines are made to fit into each other,
  so that instead of having a straight band with the edge merely toothed,
  one gets an up and down zig-zag band with three complete teeth at the top
  and three complete teeth at the bottom. Whilst a fess, a bar, a bend, and
  a chief can be found dancetté, I do not see how it would be possible to
  draw a saltire or a cross dancetté. At any rate the resulting figure
  would be most ugly, and would appear ill-balanced. A pile and a chevron
  seem equally impossible, though there does not <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="118.png"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>seem to
  be the like objection to a pale dancetté. An instance of a bend dancetté
  is found in the arms of Cuffe (Lord Desart), which are: Argent, on a bend
  dancetté sable, plain cotised azure, three fleurs-de-lis, and on each
  cotise as many bezants.</p>

  <p><i>Wavy</i> or <i>undy</i>, which is supposed to have been taken from
  water, and <i>nebuly</i>, which is supposed to be derived from clouds,
  are of course lines which are well known. They are equally applicable to
  any ordinary and to any partition of the field; but in both cases it
  should be noticed by artists that there is no one definite or accepted
  method of depicting these lines, and one is quite at liberty, and might
  be recommended, to widen out the indentations, or to increase them in
  height, as the artistic requirements of the work in hand may seem to
  render advisable. It is only by bearing this in mind and treating these
  lines with freedom that really artistic work can sometimes be produced
  where they occur. There is no fixed rule either as to the width which
  these lines may occupy or as to the number of indentations as compared
  with the width of the shield, and it is a pity to introduce or recognise
  any regulations of this character where none exist. There are writers who
  think it not unlikely that vairé and barry nebuly were one and the same
  thing. It is at any rate difficult in some old representations to draw
  any noticeable distinctions between the methods of depicting barry nebuly
  and vair.</p>

  <p>The line <i>raguly</i> has been the subject of much discussion. It,
  and the two which follow, viz. potenté and dovetailed, are all
  comparatively modern introductions. It would be interesting if some
  enthusiast would go carefully through the ancient Rolls of Arms and find
  the earliest occurrences of these terms. My own impression is that they
  would all be found to be inventions of the mediæval writers on heraldry.
  Raguly is the same as embattled, with the crenellations put upon the
  slant. Some writers say they should slant one way, others give them
  slanting the reverse. In a pale or a bend the teeth must point upwards;
  but in a fess I should hesitate to say whether it were more correct for
  them to point to the dexter or to the sinister, and I am inclined to
  consider that either is perfectly correct. At any rate, whilst they are
  usually drawn inclined to the dexter, in Woodward and Burnett they are to
  the sinister, and Guillim gives them turned to the dexter, saying, "This
  form of line I never yet met with in use as a partition, though
  frequently in composing of ordinaries referring them like to the trunks
  of trees with the branches lopped off, and that (as I take it) it was
  intended to represent." Modern heraldry supplies an instance which in the
  days of Mr. Guillim, of course, did not exist to refer to. This instance
  occurs in the arms of the late Lord Leighton, which were: "Quarterly per
  fesse raguly or and gules, in the second and <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="119.png"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span>third
  quarters a wyvern of the first." It is curious that Guillim, even in the
  edition of 1724, does not mention any of the remaining terms. Dovetailed
  in modern armory is even yet but seldom made use of, though I can quote
  two instances of coats of arms in which it is to be found, namely, the
  arms of Kirk, which are: "Gules, a chevron dovetailed ermine, on a chief
  argent, three dragons' heads couped of the field;" and Ambrose: "Azure,
  two lions passant in pale argent, on a chief dovetailed of the last, a
  fleur-de-lis between two annulets of the first." Other instances of
  dovetailed used as a line of partition will be found in the case of the
  arms of Farmer, which are: "Per chevron dovetailed gules and argent, in
  chief two lions' heads erased of the last, and in base a salamander in
  flames proper;" and in the arms of Fenton namely: "Per pale argent and
  sable, a cross dovetailed, in the first and fourth quarters a
  fleur-de-lis, and in the second and third a trefoil slipped all
  countercharged." There are, of course, many others. The term
  <i>potenté</i>, as will be seen from a reference to Fig. 47, is used to
  indicate a line which follows the form of the division lines in the fur
  potent. As one of the partition lines potenté is very rare.</p>

  <p>As to the term <i>urdy</i>, which is given in Woodward and Burnett and
  also in Berry, I can only say I personally have never come across an
  instance of its use as a partition line. A cross or a billet urdy one
  knows, but urdy as a partition line I have yet to find. It is significant
  that it is omitted in Parker except as a term applicable to a cross, and
  the instances and variations given by Berry, "urdy in point paleways" and
  "contrary urdy," I should be much more inclined to consider as variations
  of vair; and, though it is always well to settle points which can be
  settled, I think urdy and its use as a partition line may be well left
  for further consideration when examples of it come to hand.</p>

  <p>There is one term, however, which is to be met with at the present
  time, but which I have never seen quoted in any text-book under the
  heading of a partition line; that is, "flory counter-flory," which is of
  course formed by a succession of fleurs-de-lis alternately reversed and
  counterchanged. They might of course be blazoned after the quotation of
  the field as "per bend" or "per chevron" as the case might be, simply as
  so many fleurs-de-lis counterchanged, and alternately reversed in a
  specified position; but this never appears to be the case, and
  consequently the fleurs-de-lis would appear to be essentially parts of
  the field and not charges. I have sometimes thought whether it would not
  be more correct to depict "per something" flory and counter-flory without
  completing the fleurs-de-lis, simply leaving the alternate tops of the
  fleurs-de-lis to show. In the cases of the illustrations which have come
  under my notice, however, the whole fleur-de-lis is depicted, and as an
  instance of the use of the term may be mentioned the arms of <!-- Page 96
  --><span class="pagenum" title="120.png"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>Dumas, which are: "Per chevron flory and
  counter-flory or and azure, in chief two lions' gambs erased, and in base
  a garb counterchanged." But when the term flory and counter-flory is used
  in conjunction with an ordinary, <i>e.g.</i> a fess flory and
  counter-flory, the <i>half</i> fleurs-de-lis, only alternately reversed,
  are represented on the <i>outer</i> edges of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>I think also that the word "<i>arched</i>" should now be included as a
  partition line. I confess that the only form in which I know of it is
  that it is frequently used by the present Garter King of Arms in
  designing coats of arms with chiefs arched. Recently Garter has granted a
  coat with a chief double arched. But if a chief can be arched I see no
  reason why a fesse or a bar cannot equally be so altered, and in that
  case it undoubtedly becomes a recognised line of partition. Perhaps it
  should be stated that a chief arched is a chief with its base line one
  arc of a large circle. The diameter of the circle and the consequent
  acuteness of the arch do not appear to be fixed by any definite rule, and
  here again artistic requirements must be the controlling factor in any
  decision. Elvin in his "Dictionary of Heraldic Terms" gives a curious
  assortment of lines, the most curious of all, perhaps, being indented
  embowed, or hacked and hewed. Where such a term originated or in what
  coat of arms it is to be found I am ignorant, but the appearance is
  exactly what would be presented by a piece of wood hacked with an axe at
  regular intervals. Elvin again makes a difference between bretessed and
  embattled-counter-embattled, making the embattlement on either side of an
  ordinary identical in the former and alternated in the latter. He also
  makes a difference between raguly, which is the conventional form
  universally adopted, and raguled and trunked, where the ordinary takes
  the representation of the trunk of a tree with the branches lopped; but
  these and many others that he gives are refinements of idea which
  personally I should never expect to find in actual use, and of the
  instances of which I am unaware. I think, however, the term
  "<i>rayonné</i>," which is found in both the arms of O'Hara and the arms
  of Colman, and which is formed by the addition of rays to the ordinary,
  should take a place amongst lines of partition, though I admit I know of
  no instance in which it is employed to divide the field.</p>

<h5>METHODS OF PARTITION</h5>

  <p>The field of any coat of arms is the surface colour of the shield, and
  is supposed to include the area within the limits formed by its outline.
  There are, as has been already stated, but few coats of a single colour
  minus a charge to be found in British heraldry. But there <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum" title="121.png"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>are many which consist of a field divided by
  partition lines only, of which some instances were given on page <a
  href="#page69">69</a>.</p>

  <p>A shield may be divided by partition lines running in the direction of
  almost any "ordinary," in which case the field will be described as "per
  bend" or "per chevron," &amp;c. It may be:</p>

<table class="mc">

  <p>But a field cannot be "per pile" or "per chief," because there is no

  <p>Another method of partition will be found in the fields "checky" (or
  "chequy") and lozengy; but these divisions, as also the foregoing, will
  be treated more specifically under the different ordinaries. A field
  which is party need not necessarily have all its lines of partition the
  same. This peculiarity, however, seldom occurs except in the case of a
  field quarterly, the object in coats of this character being to prevent
  different quarters of one coat of arms being ranked as or taken to be
  quarterings representing different families. <!-- Page 99 --><span

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER VIII</h5>

<h5>THE RULES OF BLAZON</h5>

  <p>The word "Blazon" is used with some number of meanings, but
  practically it may be confined to the verb "to blazon," which is to
  describe in words a given coat of arms, and the noun "blazon," which is
  such a description.</p>

  <p>Care should be taken to differentiate between the employment of the
  term "blazon" and the verb "to emblazon," which latter means to depict in
  colour.</p>

  <p>It may here be remarked, however, that to illustrate by the use of
  outline with written indications of colour is termed "to trick," and a
  picture of arms of this character is termed "a trick."</p>

  <p>The term <i>trick</i> has of late been extended (though one almost
  thinks improperly) to include representations of arms in which the
  colours are indicated by the specified tincture lines which have been
  already referred to.</p>

  <p>The subject of blazon has of late acquired rather more importance than
  has hitherto been conceded to it, owing to an unofficial attempt to
  introduce a new system of blazoning under the guise of a supposed
  reversion to earlier forms of description. This it is not, but even if it
  were what it claims to be, merely the revival of ancient forms and
  methods, its reintroduction cannot be said to be either expedient or
  permissible, because the ancient practice does not permit of extension to
  the limits within which more modern armory has developed, and modern
  armory, though less ancient, is armory equally with the more ancient and
  simpler examples to be found in earlier times. To ignore modern armory is
  simply futile and absurd.</p>

  <p>The rules to be employed in blazon are simple, and comparatively few
  in number.</p>

  <p>The commencement of any blazon is of necessity a description of the
  <i>field</i>, the one word signifying its colour being employed if it be
  a simple field; or, if it be composite, such terms as are necessary.
  Thus, a coat divided "per pale" or "per chevron" is so described, and
  whilst the Scottish field of this character is officially termed "Parted"
  [per pale, or per chevron], the English equivalent is "Party," though
  this <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum" title="124.png"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>word in English usage is more often
  omitted than not in the blazon which commences "per pale," or "per
  chevron," as the case may be.</p>

  <p>The description of the different colours and different divisions of
  the field have all been detailed in earlier chapters, but it may be added
  that in a "party" coloured field, that colour or tincture is mentioned
  first which occupies the more important part of the escutcheon. Thus, in
  a field "per bend," "per chevron," or "per fess," the upper portion of
  the field is first referred to; in a coat "per pale," the dexter side is
  the more important; and in a coat "quarterly," the tinctures of the 1st
  and 4th quarters are given precedence of the tinctures of the 2nd and
  3rd. The only division upon which there has seemed any uncertainty is the
  curious one "gyronny," but the correct method to be employed in this case
  can very easily be recognised by taking the first quarter of the field,
  and therein considering the field as if it were simply "per bend."</p>

  <p>After the field has been described, anything of which the field is
  semé must next be alluded to, <i>e.g.</i> gules, semé-de-lis or,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The second thing to be mentioned in the blazon is the principal
  charge. We will consider first those cases in which it is an ordinary.
  Thus, one would speak of "Or, a chevron gules," or, if there be other
  charges as well as the ordinary, "Azure, a bend between two horses' heads
  or," or "Gules, a chevron between three roses argent."</p>

  <p>The colour of the ordinary is not mentioned until after the charge, if
  it be the same as the latter, but if it be otherwise it must of course be
  specified, as in the coat: "Or, a fess gules between three crescents
  sable." If the ordinary is charged, the charges thereupon, being less
  important than the charges in the field, are mentioned subsequently, as
  in the coat: "Gules, on a bend argent between two fountains proper, a
  rose gules between two mullets sable."</p>

  <p>The position of the charges need not be specified when they would
  naturally fall into a certain position with regard to the ordinaries.
  Thus, a chevron between three figures of necessity has two in chief and
  one in base. A bend between two figures of necessity has one above and
  one below. A fess has two above and one below. A cross between four has
  one in each angle. In none of these cases is it necessary to state the
  position. If, however, those positions or numbers do not come within the
  category mentioned, care must be taken to specify what the coat exactly
  is.</p>

  <p>If a bend is accompanied only by one charge, the position of this
  charge must be stated. For example: "Gules, a bend or, in chief a
  crescent argent." A chevron with four figures would be described:
  "Argent, a chevron between three escallops in chief and one in base
  sable," though it would be equally correct to say: "Argent, a chevron
  <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum" title="125.png"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>between four escallops, three in chief and
  one in base sable." In the same way we should get: "Vert, on a cross or,
  and in the 1st quarter a bezant, an estoile sable;" though, to avoid
  confusion, this coat would more probably be blazoned: "Vert, a cross or,
  charged with an estoile sable, and in the first quarter a bezant." This
  example will indicate the latitude which is permissible if, for the sake
  of avoiding confusion and making a blazon more readily understandable,
  some deviation from the strict formulas would appear to be desirable.</p>

  <p>If there be no ordinary on a shield, the charge which occupies the
  chief position is mentioned first. For example: "Or, a lion rampant sable
  between three boars' heads erased gules, two in chief and one in base."
  Many people, however, would omit any reference to the position of the
  boars' heads, taking it for granted that, as there were only three, they
  would be 2 and 1, which is the normal position of three charges in any
  coat of arms. If, however, the coat of arms had the three boars' heads
  all above the lion, it would then be necessary to blazon it: "Or, a lion
  rampant sable, in chief three boars' heads erased gules."</p>

  <p>When a field is <i>semé</i> of anything, this is taken to be a part of
  the field, and not a representation of a number of charges. Consequently
  the arms of Long are blazoned: "Sable, semé of cross crosslets, a lion
  rampant argent." As a matter of fact the semé of cross crosslets is
  always termed <i>crusilly</i>, as has been already explained.</p>

  <p>When charges are placed around the shield in the position they would
  occupy if placed upon a bordure, these charges are said to be "in orle,"
  as in the arms of Hutchinson: "Quarterly, azure and gules, a lion rampant
  erminois, within four cross crosslets argent, and as many bezants
  alternately in orle;" though it is equally permissible to term charges in
  such a position "an orle of [<i>e.g.</i> cross crosslets argent and
  bezants alternately]," or so many charges "in orle" (see Fig. 60).</p>

  <p>If an ordinary be engrailed, or invected, this fact is at once stated,
  the term occurring before the colour of the ordinary. Thus: "Argent, on a
  chevron nebuly between three crescents gules, as many roses of the
  field." When a charge upon an ordinary is the same colour as the field,
  the name of the colour is not repeated, but those charges are said to be
  "of the field."</p>

  <p>It is the constant endeavour, under the recognised system, to avoid
  the use of the name of the same colour a second time in the blazon. Thus:
  "Quarterly, gules and or, a cross counterchanged between in the first
  quarter a sword erect proper, pommel and hilt of the second; in the
  second quarter a rose of the first, barbed and seeded of the third; in
  the third quarter a fleur-de-lis azure; and <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="126.png"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>in the
  fourth quarter a mullet <i>gold</i>"&mdash;the use of the term "gold"
  being alone permissible in such a case.</p>

  <p>Any animal which needs to be described, also needs its position to be
  specified. It may be rampant, segreant, passant, statant, or trippant, as
  the case may be. It may also sometimes be necessary to specify its
  position upon the shield, but the terms peculiarly appropriated to
  specific animals will be given in the chapters in which these animals are
  dealt with.</p>

  </div>

  <p>With the exception of the chief, the quarter, the canton, the flaunch,
  and the bordure, an ordinary or sub-ordinary is always of greater
  importance, and therefore should be mentioned before any other charge,
  but in the cases alluded to the remainder of the shield is first
  blazoned, before attention is paid to these figures. Thus we should get:
  "Argent, a chevron between three mullets gules, on a chief of the last
  three crescents of the second;" or "Sable, a lion rampant between three
  fleurs-de-lis or, on a canton argent a mascle of the field;" or "Gules,
  two chevronels between three mullets pierced or, within a bordure
  engrailed argent charged with eight roses of the field." The arms in Fig.
  61 are an interesting example of this point. They are those of John de
  Bretagne, Earl of Richmond (<i>d.</i> 1334), and would properly be
  blazoned: "Chequy or and azure, a bordure gules, charged with lions
  passant guardant or ('a bordure of England'), over all a canton
  (sometimes a quarter) ermine."</p>

    arms of John de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond.</p>
  </div>

  <p>If two ordinaries or sub-ordinaries appear in the same field, certain
  discretion needs to be exercised, but the arms of Fitzwalter, for
  example, are as follows: "Or, a fess between two chevrons gules."</p>

  <p>When charges are placed in a series following the direction of any
  ordinary they are said to be "in bend," "in chevron," or "in pale," as
  the case may be, and not only must their position on the shield as
  regards each other be specified, but their individual direction must also
  be noted.</p>

  <p>A coat of arms in which three spears were placed side by side, but
  each erect, would be blazoned: "Gules, three tilting-spears palewise in
  fess;" but if the spears were placed horizontally, one above the other,
  they would be blazoned: "Three tilting-spears fesswise in pale," <!--
  Page 103 --><span class="pagenum" title="127.png"><a
  name="page103"></a>{103}</span>because in the latter case each spear is
  placed fesswise, but the three occupy in relation to each other the
  position of a pale. Three tilting-spears fesswise which were not <i>in
  pale</i> would be depicted 2 and 1.</p>

  <p>When one charge surmounts another, the undermost one is mentioned
  first, as in the arms of Beaumont (see Fig. 62). Here the lion rampant is
  the principal charge, and the bend which debruises it is consequently
  mentioned afterwards.</p>

  <p>In the cases of a cross and of a saltire, the charges when all are
  alike would simply be described as between four objects, though the term
  "cantonned by" four objects is sometimes met with. If the objects are not
  the same, they must be specified as being in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
  quarters, if the ordinary be a cross. If it be a saltire, it will be
  found that in Scotland the charges are mentioned as being in chief and
  base, and in the "flanks." In England they would be described as being
  <i>in pale</i> and <i>in fess</i> if the alternative charges are the
  same; if not, they would be described as <i>in chief</i>, on the dexter
  side, on the sinister side, and <i>in base</i>.</p>

    and a lion rampant or, over all a bend gobony argent and gules. (From
    his seal.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>When a specified number of charges is immediately followed by the same
  number of charges elsewhere disposed, the number is not repeated, the
  words "as many" being substituted instead. Thus: "Argent, on a chevron
  between three roses gules, as many crescents of the field." When any
  charge, ordinary, or mark of cadency surmounts a single object, that
  object is termed "debruised" by that ordinary. If it surmounts
  <i>everything</i>, as, for instance, "a bendlet sinister," this would be
  termed "over all." When a coat of arms is "party" coloured in its field
  and the charges are alternately of the same colours transposed, the term
  <i>counterchanged</i> is used. For example, "Party per pale argent and
  sable, three chevronels between as many mullets pierced all
  counterchanged." In that case the coat is divided down the middle, the
  dexter field being argent, and the sinister sable; the charges on the
  sable being argent, whilst the charges on the argent are sable. A mark of
  cadency is mentioned last, and is termed "for difference"; a mark of
  bastardy, or a mark denoting lack of blood descent, is termed "for
  distinction."</p>

  <p>Certain practical hints, which, however, can hardly be termed rules,
  were suggested by the late Mr. J. Gough Nicholls in 1863, when writing in
  the <i>Herald and Genealogist</i>, and subsequent practice has since
  conformed therewith, though it may be pointed out with advantage that
  these suggestions are practically, and to all intents and purposes, <!--
  Page 104 --><span class="pagenum" title="128.png"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>the same rules which have been observed
  officially over a long period. Amongst these suggestions he advises that
  the blazoning of every coat or quarter should begin with a capital
  letter, and that, save on the occurrence of proper names, no other
  capitals should be employed. He also suggests that punctuation marks
  should be avoided as much as possible, his own practice being to limit
  the use of the comma to its occurrence after each tincture. He suggests
  also that figures should be omitted in all cases except in the numbering
  of quarterings.</p>

  <p>When one or more quarterings occur, each is treated separately on its
  own merits and blazoned entirely without reference to any other
  quartering.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:11%;">
      <a href="images/fig063.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig063.png"

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig. 63</span>.&mdash;A to

    side. A, dexter chief; B, sinister chief; C, dexter base; D, sinister
    base. 1, 2, 3, chief; 7, 8, 9, base; 2, 5, 8, pale; 4, 5, 6, fess; 5,
    fess point.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In blazoning a coat in which some quarterings (grand quarterings) are
  composed of several coats placed sub-quarterly, sufficient distinction is
  afforded for English purposes of writing or printing if Roman numerals
  are employed to indicate the grand quarters, and Arabic figures the
  sub-quarters. But in <i>speaking</i> such a method would need to be
  somewhat modified in accordance with the Scottish practice, which
  describes grand quarterings as such, and so alludes to them.</p>

  <p>The extensive use of bordures, charged and uncharged, in Scotland,
  which figure sometimes round the sub-quarters, sometimes round the grand
  quarters, and sometimes round the entire escutcheon, causes so much
  confusion that for the purposes of blazoning it is essential that the
  difference between quarters and grand quarters should be clearly
  defined.</p>

  <p>In order to simplify the blazoning of a shield, and so express the
  position of the charges, the <i>field</i> has been divided into
  <i>points</i>, of which those placed near the top, and to the dexter, are
  always considered the more important. In heraldry, dexter and sinister
  are determined, not from the point of view of the onlooker, but from that
  of the bearer of the shield. The diagram (Fig. 63) will serve to explain
  the plan of a shield's surface.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:8%;">
      <a href="images/fig064.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig064.png"
      alt="Fig. 64." title="Fig. 64." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 64.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>If a second shield be placed upon the fess point, this is called an
  inescutcheon (in German, the "heart-shield"). The enriching of the shield
  with an inescutcheon came into lively use in Germany in the course of the
  latter half of the fifteenth century. Later on, further points of honour
  were added, as the honour point (a, Fig. 64), and the nombril point (b,
  Fig. 64). These extra shields laid upon the others should correspond as
  much as possible in shape to the chief shield. If between the
  inescutcheon and the chief shield still another be inserted, <!-- Page
  105 --><span class="pagenum" title="129.png"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span>it is called the "middle shield," from its
  position, but except in Anglicised versions of Continental arms, these
  distinctions are quite foreign to British armory.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, it may be stated that although the foregoing are the
  rules which are usually observed, and that every effort should be made to
  avoid unnecessary tautology, and to make the blazon as brief as possible,
  it is by no manner of means considered officially, or unofficially, that
  any one of these rules is so unchangeable that in actual practice it
  cannot be modified if it should seem advisable so to do. For the
  essential necessity of accuracy is of far greater importance than any
  desire to be brief, or to avoid tautology. This should be borne in mind,
  and also the fact that in official practice no such hide-bound character
  is given to these rules, as one is led to believe is the case when
  perusing some of the ordinary text-books of armory. They certainly are
  not laws, they are hardly "rules," perhaps being better described as
  accepted methods of blazoning. <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum" title="130.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER IX</h5>

<h5>THE SO-CALLED ORDINARIES AND SUB-ORDINARIES</h5>

  <p>Arms, and the charges upon arms, have been divided into many
  fantastical divisions. There is a type of the precise mind much evident
  in the scientific writing of the last and the preceding centuries which
  is for ever unhappy unless it can be dividing the object of its
  consideration into classes and divisions, into sub-classes and
  sub-divisions. Heraldry has suffered in this way; for, oblivious of the
  fact that the rules enunciated are impossible as rigid guides for general
  observance, and that they never have been complied with, and that they
  never will be, a "tabular" system has been evolved for heraldry as for
  most other sciences. The "precise" mind has applied a system obviously
  derived from natural history classification to the principles of armory.
  It has selected a certain number of charges, and has been pleased to term
  them ordinaries. It has selected others which it has been pleased to term
  sub-ordinaries. The selection has been purely arbitrary, at the pleasure
  of the writer, and few writers have agreed in their classifications. One
  of the foremost rules which former heraldic writers have laid down is
  that an ordinary must contain the third part of the field. Now it is
  doubtful whether an ordinary has ever been drawn containing the third
  part of the field by rigid measurement, except in the solitary instance
  of the pale, when it is drawn "per fess counterchanged," for the obvious
  <i>purpose</i> of dividing the shield into six equal portions, a practice
  which has been lately pursued very extensively owing to the ease with
  which, by its adoption, a new coat of arms can be designed bearing a
  distinct resemblance to one formerly in use without infringing the rights
  of the latter. Certainly, if the ordinary is the solitary charge upon the
  shield, it will be drawn about that specified proportion. But when an
  attempt is made to draw the Walpole coat (which cannot be said to be a
  modern one) so that it shall exhibit three ordinaries, to wit, one fess
  and two chevrons (which being interpreted as three-thirds of the shield,
  would fill it entirely), and yet leave a goodly proportion of the field
  still visible, the absurdity is apparent. And a very large proportion of
  the classification and rules which occupy such a large proportion of the
  space in the majority of heraldic text-books are equally unnecessary,
  <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum" title="131.png"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>confusing, and incorrect, and what is very
  much more important, such rules have never been recognised by the powers
  that have had the control of armory from the beginning of that control
  down to the present day. I shall not be surprised to find that many of my
  critics, bearing in mind how strenuously I have pleaded elsewhere for a
  right and proper observance of the laws of armory, may think that the
  foregoing has largely the nature of a recantation. It is nothing of the
  kind, and I advocate as strenuously as I have ever done, the compliance
  with and the observance of every rule which can be shown to exist. But
  this is no argument whatever for the idle invention of rules which never
  have existed; or for the recognition of rules which have no other origin
  than the imagination of heraldic writers. Nor is it an argument for the
  deduction of unnecessary regulations from cases which can be shown to
  have been exceptions. Too little recognition is paid to the fact that in
  armory there are almost as many rules of exception as original rules.
  There are vastly more plain exceptions to the rules which should govern
  them.</p>

  <p>On the subject of ordinaries, I cannot see wherein lies the difference
  between a bend and a lion rampant, save their difference in form, yet the
  one is said to be an ordinary, the other is merely a charge. Each has its
  special rules to be observed, and whilst a bend can be engrailed or
  invected, a lion can be guardant or regardant; and whilst the one can be
  placed between two objects, which objects will occupy a specified
  position, so can the other. Each can be charged, and each furnishes an
  excellent example of the futility of some of the ancient rules which have
  been coined concerning them. The ancient rules allow of but one lion and
  one bend upon a shield, requiring that two bends shall become bendlets,
  and two lions lioncels, whereas the instance we have already
  quoted&mdash;the coat of Walpole&mdash;has never been drawn in such form
  that either of the chevrons could have been considered chevronels, and it
  is rather late in the day to degrade the lions of England into unblooded
  whelps. To my mind the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries are no more than
  first charges, and though the bend, the fess, the pale, the pile, the
  chevron, the cross, and the saltire will always be found described as
  honourable ordinaries, whilst the chief seems also to be pretty
  universally considered as one of the honourable ordinaries, such hopeless
  confusion remains as to the others (scarcely any two writers giving
  similar classifications), that the utter absurdity of the necessity for
  any classification at all is amply demonstrated. Classification is only
  necessary or desirable when a certain set of rules can be applied
  identically to all the set of figures in that particular class. Even this
  will not hold with the ordinaries which have been quoted. <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum" title="132.png"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span></p>

  <p>A pale embattled is embattled upon both its edges; a fess embattled is
  embattled only upon the upper edge; a chief is embattled necessarily only
  upon the lower; and the grave difficulty of distinguishing "per pale
  engrailed" from "per pale invected" shows that no rigid rules can be laid
  down. When we come to sub-ordinaries, the confusion is still more
  apparent, for as far as I can see the only reason for the classification
  is the tabulating of rules concerning the lines of partition. The bordure
  and the orle can be, and often are, engrailed or embattled; the fret, the
  lozenge, the fusil, the mascle, the rustre, the flanche, the roundel, the
  billet, the label, the pairle, it would be practically impossible to
  meddle with; and all these figures have at some time or another, and by
  some writer or other, been included amongst either the ordinaries or the
  sub-ordinaries. In fact there is no one quality which these charges
  possess in common which is not equally possessed by scores of other
  well-known charges, and there is no particular reason why a certain set
  should be selected and dignified by the name of ordinaries; nor are there
  any rules relating to ordinaries which require the selection of a certain
  number of figures, or of any figures to be controlled by those rules,
  with one exception. The exception is to be found not in the rules
  governing the ordinaries, but in the rules of blazon. After the field has
  been specified, the principal charge must be mentioned first, and no
  charge can take precedence of a bend, fess, pale, pile, chevron, cross,
  or saltire, except one of themselves. If there be any reason for a
  subdivision those charges must stand by themselves, and might be termed
  the honourable ordinaries, but I can see no reason for treating the
  chief, the quarter, the canton, gyron, flanche, label, orle, tressure,
  fret, inescutcheon, chaplet, bordure, lozenge, fusil, mascle, rustre,
  roundel, billet, label, shakefork, and pairle, as other than ordinary
  charges. They certainly are purely heraldic, and each has its own special
  rules, but so in heraldry have the lion, griffin, and deer. Here is the
  complete list of the so-called ordinaries and sub-ordinaries: The bend;
  fess; bar; chief; pale; chevron; cross; saltire; pile; pairle, shakefork
  or pall; quarter; canton; gyron; bordure; orle; tressure; flanche; label,
  fret; inescutcheon; chaplet; lozenge; fusil; mascle; rustre; roundel;
  billet, together with the diminutives of such of these as are in use.</p>

  <p>With reference to the origin of these ordinaries, by the use of which
  term is meant for the moment the rectilinear figures peculiar to armory,
  it may be worth the passing mention that the said origin is a matter of
  some mystery. Guillim and the old writers almost universally take them to
  be derived from the actual military scarf or a representation of it
  placed across the shield in various forms. Other writers, taking the
  surcoat and its decoration as the real origin of coats of arms, derive
  <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum" title="133.png"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>the ordinaries from the belt, scarf, and
  other articles of raiment. Planché, on the other hand, scouted such a
  derivation, putting forward upon very good and plausible grounds the
  simple argument that the origin of the ordinaries is to be found in the
  cross-pieces of wood placed across a shield for strengthening purposes.
  He instances cases in which shields, apparently charged with ordinaries
  but really strengthened with cross-pieces, can be taken back to a period
  long anterior to the existence of regularised armory. But then, on the
  other hand, shields can be found decorated with animals at an equally
  early or even an earlier period, and I am inclined myself to push
  Planché's own argument even farther than he himself took it, and assert
  unequivocally that the ordinaries had in themselves no particular
  symbolism and no definable origin whatever beyond that easy method of
  making some pattern upon a shield which was to be gained by using
  straight lines. That they ever had any military meaning, I cannot see the
  slightest foundation to believe; their suggested and asserted symbolism I
  totally deny. But when we can find, as Planché did, that shields were
  strengthened with cross-pieces in various directions, it is quite natural
  to suppose that these cross-pieces afforded a ready means of decoration
  in colour, and this would lead a good deal of other decoration to follow
  similar forms, even in the absence of cross-pieces upon the definite
  shield itself. The one curious point which rather seems to tell against
  Planché's theory is that in the earliest "rolls" of arms but a
  comparatively small proportion of the arms are found to consist of these
  rectilinear figures, and if the ordinaries really originated in
  strengthening cross-pieces one would have expected a larger number of
  such coats of arms to be found; but at the same time such arms would, in
  many cases, in themselves be so palpably mere meaningless decoration of
  cross-pieces upon plain shields, that the resulting design would not
  carry with it such a compulsory remembrance as would a design, for
  example, derived from lines which had plainly had no connection with the
  construction of the shield. Nor could it have any such basis of
  continuity. Whilst a son would naturally paint a lion upon his shield if
  his father had done the same, there certainly would not be a similar
  inducement for a son to follow his father's example where the design upon
  a shield were no more than different-coloured strengthening pieces,
  because if these were gilt, for example, the son would naturally be no
  more inclined to perpetuate a particular form of strengthening for his
  shield, which might not need it, than any particular artistic division
  with which it was involved, so that the absence of arms composed of
  ordinaries from the early rolls of arms may not amount to so very much.
  Still further, it may well be concluded that the compilers of early rolls
  <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum" title="134.png"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>of arms, or the collectors of the details
  from which early rolls were made at a later date, may have been tempted
  to ignore, and may have been justified in discarding from their lists of
  arms, those patterns and designs which palpably were then no more than a
  meaningless colouring of the strengthening pieces, but which patterns and
  designs by subsequent continuous usage and perpetuation became accepted
  later by certain families as the "arms" their ancestors had worn. It is
  easy to see that such meaningless patterns would have less chance of
  survival by continuity of usage, and at the same time would require a
  longer continuity of usage, before attaining to fixity as a definite
  design.</p>

  <p>The undoubted symbolism of the cross in so many early coats of arms
  has been urged strongly by those who argue either for a symbolism for all
  these rectilinear figures or for an origin in articles of dress. But the
  figure of the cross preceded Christianity and organised armory, and it
  had an obvious decorative value which existed before, and which exists
  now outside any attribute it may have of a symbolical nature. That it is
  an utterly fallacious argument must be admitted when it is remembered
  that two lines at right angles make a cross&mdash;probably the earliest
  of all forms of decoration&mdash;and that the cross existed before its
  symbolism. Herein it differs from other forms of decoration (e.g. the
  Masonic emblems) which cannot be traced beyond their symbolical
  existence. The cross, like the other heraldic rectilinear figures, came
  into existence, meaningless as a decoration for a shield, before armory
  as such existed, and probably before Christianity began. Then being in
  existence the Crusading instinct doubtless caused its frequent selection
  with an added symbolical meaning. But the argument can truthfully be
  pushed no farther.</p>

<h5>THE BEND</h5>

  <p>The bend is a broad band going from the dexter chief corner to the
  sinister base (Fig. 65). According to the old theorists this should
  contain the third part of the field. As a matter of fact it hardly ever
  does, and seldom did even in the oldest examples. Great latitude is
  allowed to the artist on this point, in accordance with whether the bend
  be plain or charged, and more particularly according to the charges which
  accompany it in the shield and their disposition thereupon.</p>

  <p>"Azure, a bend or," is the well-known coat concerning which the
  historic controversy was waged between Scrope and Grosvenor. As every one
  knows, it was finally adjudged to belong to the former, and a right to it
  has also been proved by the Cornish family of Carminow. <!-- Page 111
  --><span class="pagenum" title="135.png"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>

  <p>A bend is, of course, subject to the usual variations of the lines of
  partition (Figs. 66-75).</p>

  <p>A bend compony (Fig. 76), will be found in the arms of Beaumont, and
  the difference between this (in which the panes run with the bend) and a
  bend barry (in which the panes are horizontal, Fig. 77), as in the arms
  of King,<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> should be
  noticed.</p>

  <p>A bend wavy is not very usual, but will be found in the arms of
  Wallop, De Burton, and Conder. A bend raguly appears in the arms of
  Strangman. <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum" title="136.png"><a

  <p>When a bend and a bordure appear upon the same arms, the bend is not
  continued over the bordure, and similarly it does not surmount a tressure
  (Fig. 78), but stops within it.</p>

  <p>A bend upon a bend is by no means unusual. An example of this will be
  found in a coat of Waller. Cases where this happens need to be carefully
  scrutinised to avoid error in blazoning.</p>

  <p>A bend lozengy, or of lozenges (Fig. 79), will be found in the arms of
  Bolding.</p>

  <p>A bend flory and counterflory will be found in the arms of Fellows, a
  quartering of Tweedy.</p>

  <p>A bend chequy will be found in the arms of Menteith, and it should be
  noticed that the checks run the way of the bend.</p>

  <p>Ermine spots upon a bend are represented the way of the bend.</p>

  <p>Occasionally two bends will be found, as in the arms of Lever: Argent,
  two bends sable, the upper one engrailed (<i>vide</i> Lyon
  Register&mdash;escutcheon of pretence on the arms of Goldie-Scot of
  Craigmore, 1868); or as in the arms of James Ford, of Montrose, 1804:
  Gules, two bends vairé argent and sable, on a chief or, a greyhound
  courant sable between two towers gules. A different form appears in the
  arms of Zorke or Yorke (see Papworth), which are blazoned: Azure, a bend
  argent, impaling argent, a bend azure. A solitary instance of
  <i>three</i> bends (which, however, effectually proves that a bend cannot
  <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum" title="137.png"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>occupy the third part of the field) occurs
  in the arms of Penrose, matriculated in Lyon Register in 1795 as a
  quartering of Cumming-Gordon of Altyre. These arms of Penrose are:
  Argent, three bends sable, each charged with as many roses of the
  field.</p>

  <p>A charge half the width of a bend is a bendlet (Fig. 80), and one half
  the width of a bendlet is a cottise (Fig. 81), but a cottise cannot exist
  alone, inasmuch as it has of itself neither direction nor position, but
  is only found accompanying one of the ordinaries. The arms of Harley are
  an example of a bend cottised.</p>

  <p>Bendlets will very seldom be found either in addition to a bend, or
  charged, but the arms of Vaile show both these peculiarities.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig080.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig080.png"

    80.</span>&mdash;Bendlets.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A bend will usually be found between two charges. Occasionally it will
  be found between four, but more frequently between six. In none of these
  cases is it necessary to specify the position of the subsidiary charges.
  It is presumed that the bend separates them into even numbers, but their
  exact position (beyond this) upon the shield is left to the judgment of
  the artist, and their disposition is governed by the space left available
  by the shape of the shield. A further presumption is permitted in the
  case of a bend between <i>three</i> objects, which are presumed to be two
  in chief and one in base. But even in the case of three the position will
  be usually found to be specifically stated, as would be the case with any
  other uneven number.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig081.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig081.png"
      alt="Fig. 81." title="Fig. 81." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    81.</span>&mdash;Bend cottised.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Charges on a bend are placed in the direction of the bend. In such
  cases it is not necessary to specify that the charges are bendwise. When
  a charge or charges occupy the position which a bend would, they are said
  to be placed "in bend." This is not the same thing as a charge placed
  "bendwise" (or bendways). In this case the charge itself is slanted into
  the angle at which the bend crosses the shield, but the position of the
  charge upon the shield is not governed thereby.</p>

  <p>When a bend and chief occur together in the same arms, the chief will
  usually surmount the bend, the latter issuing from the angle between the
  base of the chief and the side of the shield. An instance to the
  contrary, however, will be found in the arms of Fitz-Herbert of
  Swynnerton, in which the bend is continued over the chief. This instance,
  however (as doubtless all others of the kind), is due to the <!-- Page
  114 --><span class="pagenum" title="138.png"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>use of the bend in early times as a mark
  of difference. The coat of arms, therefore, had an earlier and separate
  existence without the bend, which has been superimposed as a difference
  upon a previously existing coat. The use of the bend as a difference will
  be again referred to when considering more fully the marks and methods of
  indicating cadency.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    82.</span>&mdash;Bend sinister.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A curious instance of the use of the sun's rays in bend will be found
  in the arms of Warde-Aldam.<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The bend sinister (Fig. 82), is very frequently stated to be the mark
  of illegitimacy. It certainly has been so used upon some occasions, but
  these occasions are very few and far between, the charge more frequently
  made use of being the bendlet or its derivative the baton (Fig. 83).
  These will be treated more fully in the chapter on the marks of
  illegitimacy. The bend sinister, which is a band running from the
  sinister chief corner through the centre of the escutcheon to the dexter
  base, need not necessarily indicate bastardy. Naturally the popular idea
  which has originated and become stereotyped concerning it renders its
  appearance extremely rare, but in at least two cases it occurs without,
  as far as I am aware, carrying any such meaning. At any rate, in neither
  case are the coats "bastardised" versions of older arms. These cases are
  the arms of Shiffner: "Azure, a bend sinister, in chief two estoiles, in
  like bend or; in base the end and stock of an anchor gold, issuing from
  waves of the sea proper;" and Burne-Jones: "Azure, on a bend sinister
  argent, between seven mullets, four in chief and three in base or, three
  pairs of wings addorsed purpure."</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    83.</span>&mdash;Baton sinister.</p>
  </div>

  <p>No coat with the chief charge a single bendlet occurs in Papworth. A
  single case, however, is to be found in the Lyon Register in the duly
  matriculated arms of Porterfield of that Ilk: "Or, a bendlet between a
  stag's head erased in chief and a hunting-horn in base sable, garnished
  gules." Single bendlets, however, both dexter and sinister, occur as
  ancient difference marks, and are then sometimes known as ribands. So
  described, it occurs in blazon of the arms of Abernethy: "Or, a lion
  rampant gules, debruised of a ribbon sable," quartered by Lindsay, Earl
  of Crawford and Balcarres; but here again the bendlet is a mark <!-- Page
  115 --><span class="pagenum" title="139.png"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>of cadency. In the <i>Gelre Armorial</i>,
  in this particular coat the ribbon is made "engrailed," which is most
  unusual, and which does not appear to be the accepted form. In many of
  the Scottish matriculations of this Abernethy coat in which this riband
  occurs it is termed a "cost," doubtless another form of the word
  cottise.</p>

  <p>When a bend or bendlets (or, in fact, any other charge) are raised
  above their natural position in the shield they are termed "enhanced"
  (Fig. 84). An instance of this occurs in the well-known coat of Byron,
  viz.: "Argent, three bendlets enhanced gules," and in the arms of
  Manchester, which were based upon this coat.</p>

  <p>When the field is composed of an even number of equal pieces divided
  by lines following the angle of a bend the field is blazoned "bendy" of
  so many (Fig. 58). In most cases it will be composed of six or eight
  pieces, but as there is no diminutive of "bendy," the number must always
  be stated.</p>

<h5>THE PALE</h5>

  <p>The pale is a broad perpendicular band passing from the top of the
  escutcheon to the bottom (Fig. 85). Like all the other ordinaries, it is
  stated to contain the third part of the area of the field, and it is the
  only one which is at all frequently drawn in that proportion. But even
  with the pale, the most frequent occasion upon which this proportion is
  definitely given, this exaggerated width will be presently explained. The
  artistic latitude, however, permits the pale to be drawn of this
  proportion if this be convenient to the charges upon it.</p>

  <p>Like the other ordinaries, the pale will be found varied by the
  different lines of partition (Figs. 86-94).</p>

  <p>The single circumstance in which the pale is regularly drawn to
  contain a full third of the field by measurement is when the coat is "per
  fess and a pale counterchanged." This, it will be noticed, divides the
  shield into six equal portions (Fig. 95). The ease with which, by <!--
  Page 116 --><span class="pagenum" title="140.png"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>the employment of these conditions, a new
  coat can be based upon an old one which shall leave three original
  charges in the same position, and upon a field of the original tincture,
  and yet shall produce an entirely different and distinct coat of arms,
  has led to this particular form being constantly repeated in modern
  grants.</p>

  <p>The arms shown in Fig. 97 are interesting inasmuch as they are
  doubtless an early form of the coat per pale indented argent and gules,
  which is generally described as a banner borne for the honour of
  Hinckley, by the Simons de Montfort, Earls of Leicester, father and son.
  In a Roll <i>temp.</i> Henry III., to Simon the younger is ascribed "Le
  Banner party endentee dargent &amp; de goules," although the arms of both
  father and son are known to have been as Fig. 98: "Gules, a lion rampant
  queue-fourchée argent." More probably the indented coat gives the
  original Montfort arms.</p>

<h5>THE FESS</h5>

  <p>The fess is a broad horizontal band crossing the escutcheon in the
  centre (Fig. 99). It is seldom drawn to contain a full third of the area
  of the shield. It is subject to the lines of partition (Figs. 100-109).
  <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum" title="142.png"><a

  <p>A curious variety of the fess dancetté is borne by the Shropshire
  family Plowden of Plowden. They bear: Azure, a fess dancetté, the upper
  points terminating in fleurs-de-lis (Fig. 110). A fess couped (Fig. 111)
  is found in the arms of Lee.</p>

  <p>The "fess embattled" is only crenellated upon the upper edge; but when
  both edges are embattled it is a fess embattled and counter-embattled.
  The term <i>bretessé</i> (which is said to indicate that the battlements
  on the upper edge are opposite the battlements on the lower edge, and the
  indentations likewise corresponding) is a term and a distinction neither
  of which are regarded in British armory. <!-- Page 119 --><span

  <p>A fess wreathed (Fig. 112) is a bearing which seems to be almost
  peculiar to the Carmichael family, but the arms of Waye of Devon are an
  additional example, being: Sable, two bars wreathed argent and gules. I
  know of no other ordinary borne in a wreathed form, but there seems no
  reason why this peculiarity should be confined to the fess.</p>

  <p>It is a fixed rule of British armory that there can be only <i>one</i>
  fess upon a shield. If two figures of this character are found they are
  termed <i>bars</i> (Fig. 113). But it is hardly correct to speak of the
  bar as a diminutive of the fess, because if two bars only appear on the
  shield there would be little, if any, diminution made from the width of
  the fess when depicting the bars. As is the case with other ordinaries,
  there is much latitude allowed to the artist in deciding the dimensions,
  it being usually permitted for these to be governed by the charges upon
  the fess or bars, and the charges between which these are placed.</p>

  <p>Bars, like the fess, are of course equally subject to all the varying
  lines of partition (Figs. 114-118).</p>

  <p>The diminutive of the bar is the barrulet, which is half its width and
  double the width of the cottise. But the barrulet will <i>almost
  invariably</i> be found borne in <i>pairs</i>, when such a pair is
  usually known as a "bar gemel" and not as two barrulets. Thus a coat with
  four barrulets <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum" title="144.png"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>would have these placed at equal distances
  from each other; but a coat with two bars gemel would be depicted with
  two of its barrulets placed closely together in chief and two placed
  closely together in base, the disposition being governed by the fact that
  the two barrulets comprising the "bar gemel" are only <i>one charge</i>.
  Fig. 119 shows three bars gemel. There is theoretically no limit to the
  number of bars or bars gemel which can be placed upon the shield. In
  practical use, however, four will be found the maximum.</p>

  <p>A field composed of four, six, eight, or ten horizontal pieces of
  equal width is "barry of such and such a number of pieces," the number
  being always specified (Figs. 55 and 56). A field composed of an equal
  number of horizontally shaped pieces, when these exceed ten in number, is
  termed "barruly" of such and such a number. The term barruly is also
  sometimes used for ten pieces. If the number is omitted "barry" will
  usually be of six pieces, though sometimes of eight. On the other hand a
  field composed of five, seven, or nine pieces is not barry, but
  (<i>e.g.</i>) two bars, three bars, and four bars respectively. This
  distinction in modern coats needs to be carefully noted, but in ancient
  coats it is not of equal importance. Anciently also a shield "barry" was
  drawn of a greater number of pieces (see Figs. 120, 121 and 122) than
  would nowadays be employed. In modern armory a field so depicted would
  more correctly be termed "barruly."</p>

  <p>Whilst a field can be and often is barry of two colours or two metals,
  an uneven number of pieces must of necessity be of metal and colour or
  fur. Consequently in a shield <i>e.g.</i> divided into seven equal
  horizontal divisions, alternately gules and sable, there must be a
  mistake somewhere.</p>

  <p>Although these distinctions require to be carefully noted as regards
  modern arms, it should be remembered that they are distinctions evolved
  by the intricacies and requirements of modern armory, and ancient arms
  were not so trammelled. <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum" title="145.png"
  ><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span></p>

  <p>A field divided horizontally into three equal divisions of <i>e.g.</i>
  gules, sable, and argent is theoretically blazoned by British rules
  "party per fess gules and argent, a fess sable." This, however, gives an
  exaggerated width to the fess which it does not really possess with us,
  and the German rules, which would blazon it "tierced per fess gules,
  sable, and argent," would seem preferable.</p>

  <p>A field which is barry may also be counterchanged, as in the arms of
  Ballingall, where it is counterchanged per pale; but it can also be
  counterchanged per chevron (Fig. 123), or per bend dexter or sinister.
  Such counterchanging should be carefully distinguished from fields which
  are "barry-bendy" (Fig. 124), or "paly-bendy" (Fig. 125). In these latter
  cases the field is divided first by lines horizontal (for barry) or
  perpendicular (for paly), and subsequently by lines bendy (dexter or
  sinister). <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum" title="146.png"><a

  <p>The result produced is very similar to "lozengy" (Fig. 126), and care
  should be taken to distinguish the two.</p>

  <p>Barry-bendy is sometimes blazoned "fusilly in bend," whilst paly-bendy
  is sometimes blazoned "fusilly in bend sinister," but the other terms are
  the more accurate and acceptable.</p>

<h5>THE CHEVRON</h5>

  <p>Probably the ordinary of most frequent occurrence in British, as also
  in French armory, is the chevron (Fig. 127). It is comparatively rare in
  German heraldry. The term is derived from the French word <i>chevron</i>,
  meaning a rafter, and the heraldic chevron is the same shape as a gable
  rafter. In early examples of heraldic art the chevron will be found
  depicted reaching very nearly to the top of the shield, the angle
  contained within the chevron being necessarily more acute. The chevron
  then attained very much more nearly to its full area of one-third of the
  field than is now given to it. As the chevron became accompanied by
  charges, it was naturally drawn so that it would allow of these charges
  being more easily represented, and its height became <!-- Page 123
  --><span class="pagenum" title="147.png"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span>less whilst the angle it enclosed was
  increased. But now, as then, it is perfectly at the pleasure of the
  artist to design his chevron at the height and angle which will best
  allow the proper representation of the charges which accompany it.</p>

  <p>The chevron, of course, is subject to the usual lines of partition
  (Figs. 128-136), and can be cottised and doubly cottised (Fig. 137).</p>

  <p>It is usually found between three charges, but the necessity of modern
  differentiation has recently introduced the disposition of four charges,
  three in chief and one in base, which is by no means a happy invention.
  An even worse disposition occurs in the arms of a certain family of
  Mitchell, where the four escallops which are the principal charges are
  arranged two in chief and two in base.</p>

  <p>Ermine spots upon a chevron do not follow the direction of it, but in
  the cases of chevrons vair, and chevrons chequy, authoritative examples
  can be found in which the chequers and rows of vair both do, and do not,
  conform to the direction of the chevron. My own preference is to make the
  rows horizontal.</p>

  <p>A chevron quarterly is divided by a line chevronwise, apparently <!--
  Page 124 --><span class="pagenum" title="148.png"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>dividing the chevron into two chevronels,
  and then by a vertical line in the centre (Fig. 138).</p>

  <p>A chevron in point embowed will be found in the arms of Trapaud
  quartered by Adlercron (Fig. 139).</p>

  <p>A field per chevron (Fig. 52) is often met with, and the division line
  in this case (like the enclosing lines of a real chevron) is subject to
  the usual partition lines, but how one is to determine the
  differentiation between per chevron engrailed and per chevron invecked I
  am uncertain, but think the points should be upwards for engrailed.</p>

  <p>The field when entirely composed of an even number of chevrons is
  termed "chevronny" (Fig. 59).</p>

  <p>The diminutive of the chevron is the chevronel (Fig. 140).</p>

  <p>Chevronels "interlaced" or "braced" (Fig. 141), will be found in the
  arms of Sirr. The chevronel is very seldom met with singly, but a case of
  this will be found in the arms of Spry.</p>

<h5>THE PILE</h5>

  <p>The pile (Fig. 143) is a triangular wedge usually (and unless
  otherwise specified) issuing from the chief. The pile is subject to the
  usual lines of partition (Figs. 144-151).</p>

  <p>The early representation of the pile (when coats of arms had no
  secondary charges and were nice and simple) made the point nearly reach
  to the base of the escutcheon, and as a consequence it naturally was not
  so wide. It is now usually drawn so that its upper edge occupies very
  nearly the whole of the top line of the escutcheon; but <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum" title="149.png"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span>the angles and proportions of the pile are
  very much at the discretion of the artist, and governed by the charges
  which need to be introduced in the field of the escutcheon or upon the
  pile.</p>

  <p>A single pile may issue from any point of the escutcheon except the
  base; the arms of Darbishire showing a pile issuing from the dexter chief
  point.</p>

  <p>A single pile cannot issue in base if it be unaccompanied by other
  piles, as the field would then be blazoned per chevron.</p>

  <p>Two piles issuing in chief will be found in the arms of Holles, Earl
  of Clare.</p>

  line of the chief, all point to the same point, touching or nearly
  touching <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum" title="150.png"><a

  Huntingdon and Chester or in the arms of Isham,<a name="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> they are described as three piles in
  point. This term and its differentiation probably are modern refinements,
  as with the early long-pointed shield any other position was impossible.
  The arms of Henderson show three piles issuing from the sinister side of
  the escutcheon.</p>

  <p>A disposition of three piles which will very frequently be found in
  modern British heraldry is two issuing in chief and one in base (Fig.
  152).</p>

  <p>Piles terminating in fleurs-de-lis or crosses patée are to be met
  with, and reference may be made to the arms of Poynter and
  Dickson-Poynder. Each of these coats has the field pily counter-pily, the
  points ending in crosses formée.</p>

  <p>An unusual instance of a pile in which it issues from a chevron will
  be found in the arms of Wright, which are: "Sable, on a chevron argent,
  three spear-heads gules, in chief two unicorns' heads erased argent,
  armed and maned or, in base on a pile of the last, issuant from the
  chevron, a unicorn's head erased of the field."</p>

<h5>THE SHAKEFORK</h5>

  <p>The pall, pairle, or shakefork (Fig. 153), is almost unknown in
  English heraldry, but in Scotland its constant occurrence in the arms of
  the Cunninghame and allied families has given it a recognised position
  among the ordinaries.</p>

  <p>As usually borne by the Cunninghame family the ends are couped and
  pointed, but in some cases it is borne throughout.</p>

  <p>The pall in its proper ecclesiastical form appears in the arms of the
  Archiepiscopal Sees of Canterbury, Armagh, and Dublin. Though <!-- Page
  127 --><span class="pagenum" title="151.png"><a
  name="page127"></a>{127}</span>in these cases the pall or pallium (Fig.
  154), is now considered to have no other heraldic status than that of an
  appropriately ecclesiastical charge upon an official coat of arms, there
  can be very little doubt that originally the pall of itself was the
  heraldic symbol in this country of an archbishop, and borne for that
  reason by all archbishops, including the Archbishop of York, although his
  official archiepiscopal coat is now changed to: "Gules, two keys in
  saltire argent, in chief a royal crown or."</p>

  <p>The necessity of displaying this device of rank&mdash;the

<h5>THE CROSS</h5>

  <p>The heraldic cross (Fig. 155), the huge preponderance of which in
  armory we of course owe to the Crusades, like all other armorial charges,
  has strangely developed. There are nearly four hundred varieties known to
  armory, or rather to heraldic text-books, and doubtless authenticated
  examples could be found of most if not of them all. But some dozen or
  twenty forms are about as many as will be found regularly or constantly
  occurring. Some but not all of the varieties of the cross are subject to
  the lines of partition (Figs. 156-161). <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="152.png"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span></p>

  <p>When the heraldic cross was first assumed with any reason beyond
  geometrical convenience, there can be no doubt that it was intended to
  represent the Sacred Cross itself. The symbolism of the cross is older
  than our present system of armory, but the cross itself is more ancient
  than its symbolism. A cross depicted upon the long, pointed shields of
  those who fought for the Cross would be of that shape, with the elongated
  arm in base.</p>

  <p>But the contemporary shortening of the shield, together with the
  introduction of charges in its angles, led naturally to the arms of the
  cross being so disposed that the parts of the field left visible were as
  nearly as possible equal. The Sacred Cross, therefore, in heraldry is now
  known as a "Passion Cross" (Fig. 162) (or sometimes as a "long cross"),
  or, if upon steps or "grieces," the number of which needs to be
  specified, as a "Cross Calvary" (Fig. 163). The crucifix (Fig. 164),
  under that description is sometimes met with as a charge.</p>

  <p>The ordinary heraldic cross (Fig. 155) is always continued throughout
  the shield unless stated to be couped (Fig. 165).</p>

  <p>Of the crosses more regularly in use may be mentioned the cross
  botonny (Fig. 166), the cross flory (Fig. 167), which must be
  distinguished from the cross fleuretté (Fig. 168); the cross moline, <!--

  <p>Of other but much more uncommon varieties examples will be found of
  the cross parted and fretty (Fig. 174), of the cross patée quadrate (Fig.
  175), of a cross pointed and voided in the arms of Dukinfield (quartered
  by Darbishire), and of a cross cleché voided and pometté as in the arms
  of Cawston. A cross quarter-pierced (Fig. 176) has the field visible at
  the centre. A cross tau or St. Anthony's Cross is shown in Fig. 177, the
  real Maltese Cross in Fig. 178, and the Patriarchal Cross in Fig. 179.

  pointed it is said to be "fitched" (Figs. 180 and 181), but when a point
  is added at the foot<i> e.g.</i> of a cross patée, it is then termed
  "fitchée at the foot" (Fig. 182).</p>

  <p>Of the hundreds of other varieties it may confidently be said that a
  large proportion originated in misunderstandings of the crude drawings of
  early armorists, added to the varying and alternating descriptions
  applied at a more pliable and fluent period of heraldic blazon. A
  striking illustration of this will be found in the cross botonny, which
  is now, and has been for a long time past, regularised with us as a
  distinct variety of <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum" title="157.png"
  ><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>constant occurrence. From early
  illustrations there is now no doubt that this was the original form, or
  one of the earliest forms, of the cross crosslet. It is foolish to ignore
  these varieties, reducing all crosses to a few original forms, for they
  are now mostly stereotyped and accepted; but at the same time it is
  useless to attempt to learn them, for in a lifetime they will mostly be
  met with but once each or thereabouts. A field semé of cross crosslets
  (Fig. 183) is termed crusilly.</p>

<h5>THE SALTIRE</h5>

  <p>The saltire or saltier (Fig. 184) is more frequently to be met with in
  Scottish than in English heraldry. This is not surprising, inasmuch as
  the saltire is known as the Cross of St. Andrew, the Patron Saint of
  Scotland. Its form is too well known to need description. It is of course
  subject to the usual partition lines (Figs. 185-192).</p>

  <p>When a saltire is charged the charges are usually placed conformably
  therewith.</p>

  <p>The field of a coat of arms is often per saltire.</p>

  <p>When one saltire couped is the principal charge it will usually be
  <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum" title="158.png"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>found that it is couped conformably to the
  outline of the shield; but if the couped saltire be one of a number or a
  subsidiary charge it will be found couped by horizontal lines, or by
  lines at right angles. The saltire has not developed into so many
  varieties of form as the cross, and (<i>e.g.</i>) a saltire botonny is
  assumed to be a cross botonny placed saltireways, but a saltire parted
  and fretty is to be met with (Fig. 193).</p>

<h5>THE CHIEF</h5>

  <p>The chief (Fig. 194), which is a broad band across the top of the
  shield containing (theoretically, but not in fact) the uppermost third of
  the area of the field, is a very favourite ordinary. It is of course
  subject to the variations of the usual partition lines (Figs. 195-203).
  It is usually drawn to contain about one-fifth of the area of the field,
  though in cases where it is used for a landscape augmentation it will
  usually be found of a rather greater area.</p>

  <p>Save in exceptional circumstances, the chief is never debruised or
  surmounted by any ordinary.</p>

  <p>The chief is ordinarily superimposed over the tressure and over the
  bordure, partly defacing them by the elimination of the upper <!-- Page
  134 --><span class="pagenum" title="160.png"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>part thereof. This happens with the
  bordure when it is a part of the original coat of arms. If, however, the
  chief were in existence at an earlier period and the bordure is added
  later as a mark of difference, the bordure surrounds the chief. On the
  other hand, if a bordure exists, even as a mark of difference, and a
  chief of augmentation is <i>subsequently</i> added, or a canton for
  distinction, the chief or the canton in these cases would surmount the
  bordure.</p>

  <p>Similarly a bend when added later as a mark of difference surmounts
  the chief. Such a case is very unusual, as the use of the bend for
  differencing has long been obsolete.</p>

  <p>A chief is never couped or cottised, and it has no diminutive in
  British armory.</p>

<h5>THE QUARTER</h5>

  <p>The quarter is not often met with in English armory, the best-known
  instance being the well-known coat of Shirley, Earl Ferrers, viz: Paly of
  six or and azure, a quarter ermine. The arms of the Earls of Richmond
  (Fig. 204) supply another instance. Of course as a division of the field
  under the blazon of "quarterly" (<i>e.g.</i> or and azure) it is
  constantly to be met with, but a single quarter is rare.</p>

  <p>Originally a single quarter was drawn to contain the full fourth part
  of the shield, but with the more modern tendency to reduce the size of
  all charges, its area has been somewhat diminished. Whilst a quarter will
  only be found within a plain partition line, a field divided quarterly
  (occasionally, but I think hardly so correctly, termed "per cross") is
  not so limited. Examples of quarterly fields will be found in the
  historic shield of De Vere (Fig. 205) and De Mandeville. An irregular
  partition line is often introduced in a new grant to conjoin quarterings
  <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum" title="161.png"><a
  name="page135"></a>{135}</span>borne without authority into one single
  coat. The diminutive of the quarter is the canton (Fig. 206), and the
  diminutive of that the chequer of a chequy field (Fig. 207).</p>

<h5>THE CANTON</h5>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig206.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig206.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    206.</span>&mdash;Canton.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The canton is supposed to occupy one-third of the chief, and that
  being supposed to occupy one-third of the field, a simple arithmetical
  sum gives us one-ninth of the field as the theoretical area of the
  canton. Curiously enough, the canton to a certain extent gives us a
  confirmation of these ancient proportions, inasmuch as all ancient
  drawings containing both a fess and a canton depict these conjoined. This
  will be seen in the Garter plate of Earl Rivers. In modern days, however,
  it is very seldom that the canton will be depicted of such a size, though
  in cases where, as in the arms of Boothby, it forms the only charge, it
  is even nowadays drawn to closely approximate to its theoretical area of
  one-ninth of the field. It may be remarked here perhaps that, owing to
  the fact that there are but few instances in which the quarter or the
  canton have been used as the sole or principal charge, a coat of arms in
  which these are employed would be granted with fewer of the modern
  bedevilments than would a coat with a chevron for example. I know of no
  instance in modern times in which a quarter, when figuring as a charge,
  or a canton have been subject to the usual lines of partition.</p>

  <p>The canton (with the single exception of the bordure, when used as a
  mark of cadency or distinction) is superimposed <i>over</i> every other
  charge or ordinary, no matter what this may be. Theoretically the canton
  is supposed to be always a later addition to the coat, and even though a
  charge may be altogether hidden or "absconded" by the canton, the charge
  is always presumed to be there, and is mentioned in the blazon.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Both a cross and a saltire are sometimes described as "cantonned" by
  such-and-such charges, when they are placed in the blank spaces left by
  these ordinaries. In addition, the spaces left by a cross (but not by a
  saltire) are frequently spoken of <i>e.g.</i> as the dexter chief canton
  or the sinister base canton. <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum" title="162.png"
  ><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span></p>

  <p>The canton is frequently used to carry an augmentation, and these
  cantons of augmentation will be referred to under that heading, though it
  may be here stated that a "canton of England" is a canton gules, charged
  with three lions passant guardant or, as in the arms of Lane (Plate
  II.).</p>

  <p>The canton, unless it is <i>an original charge</i>, need not conform
  to the rule forbidding colour on colour, or metal on metal; otherwise the
  canton of Ulster would often be an impossibility.</p>

  <p>The canton, with rare exceptions, is always placed in the dexter chief
  corner. The canton of augmentation in the arms of Clerke,
  Bart.&mdash;"Argent, on a bend gules, between three pellets as many swans
  of the field; on a sinister canton azure, a demi-ram salient of the
  first, and in chief two fleurs-de-lis or, debruised by a baton"&mdash;is,
  however, a sinister one, as is the canton upon the arms of Charlton. In
  this latter case the sinister canton is used to signify illegitimacy.
  This will be more fully dealt with in the chapter upon marks of
  illegitimacy.</p>

  <p>A curious use of the canton for the purposes of marshalling occurs in
  the case of a woman who, being an heiress herself, has a daughter or
  daughters only, whilst her husband has sons and heirs by another
  marriage. In such an event, the daughter being heir (or in the case of
  daughters these being coheirs) of the mother, but not heir of the father,
  cannot transmit as quarterings the arms of the father whom she does not
  represent, whilst she ought to transmit the arms of the mother whom she
  does represent. The husband of the daughter, therefore, places upon an
  escutcheon of pretence the arms of her mother, with those of her father
  on a canton thereupon. The children of the marriage quarter this combined
  coat, the arms of the father always remaining upon a canton. This will be
  more fully dealt with under the subject of marshalling.</p>

  <p>The canton has yet another use as a "mark of distinction." When, under
  a Royal Licence, the name and arms of a family are assumed where there is
  no blood descent from the family, the arms have some mark of distinction
  added. This is usually a plain canton. This point will be treated more
  fully under "Marks of Cadency."</p>

  <p>Woodward mentions three instances in which the lower edge of the
  canton is "indented," one taken from the Calais Roll, viz. the arms of
  Sir William de la Zouche&mdash;"Gules, bezantée, a canton indented at the
  bottom"&mdash;and adds that the canton has been sometimes thought to
  indicate the square banner of a knight-baronet, and he suggests that the
  lower edge being indented may give some weight to the idea. As the canton
  does not appear to have either previously or subsequently formed any part
  of the arms of Zouche, it is possible that in this instance some <!--
  Page 137 --><span class="pagenum" title="163.png"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span>such meaning may have been intended, but
  it can have no such application generally.</p>

  <p>The "Canton of Ulster"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> "Argent, a sinister hand
  couped at the wrist gules"&mdash;is the badge of a baronet of England,
  Ireland, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom. This badge may be borne
  upon a canton, dexter or sinister, or upon an inescutcheon, at the
  pleasure of the wearer. There is some little authority and more precedent
  for similarly treating the badge of a Nova Scotian Baronet, but as such
  Baronets <i>wear</i> their badges it is more usually depicted below the
  shield, depending by the orange tawny ribbon of their order.</p>

<h5>THE GYRON</h5>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig208.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig208.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    208.</span>&mdash;Gyronny.</p>
  </div>

  <p>As a charge, the gyron (sometimes termed an esquire) is very seldom
  found, but as a subdivision of the field, a coat "gyronny" (Fig. 208) is
  constantly met with, all arms for the name of Campbell being gyronny.
  Save in rare cases, a field gyronny is divided quarterly and then per
  saltire, making eight divisions, but it may be gyronny of six, ten,
  twelve, or more pieces, though such cases are seldom met with and always
  need to be specified. The arms of Campbell of Succoth are gyronny of
  eight <i>engrailed</i>, a most unusual circumstance. I know of no other
  instance of the use of lines of partition in a gyronny field. The arms of
  Lanyon afford an example of the gyron as a charge, as does also the
  well-known shield of Mortimer (Fig. 209).</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig209.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig209.png"

    between two base esquires of the second, over all an inescutcheon
    argent (for Mortimer); 2 and 3, or, a cross gules (for Ulster). (From
    his seal.)</p>
  </div>

<h5>THE INESCUTCHEON</h5>

  <p>The inescutcheon is a shield appearing as a charge upon the coat of
  arms. Certain writers state that it is termed an inescutcheon if only one
  appears as the charge, but that when more than one is present they are
  merely termed escutcheons. This is an unnecessary refinement not
  officially recognised or adhered to, though unconsciously one often is
  led to make this distinction, which seems to spring naturally to one's
  mind. <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum" title="164.png"><a
  name="page138"></a>{138}</span></p>

  <p>When one inescutcheon appears, it is sometimes difficult to tell
  whether to blazon the arms as charged with a bordure or an inescutcheon.
  Some coats of arms, for example the arms of Molesworth, will always
  remain more or less a matter of uncertainty.</p>

  <p>But as a matter of fact a bordure should not be wide enough to fill up
  the field left by an inescutcheon, nor an inescutcheon large enough to
  occupy the field left by a bordure.</p>

  <p>The inescutcheon in German armory (or, as they term it, the heart
  escutcheon), when superimposed upon other quarterings, is usually the
  paternal or most important coat of arms. The same method of marshalling
  has sometimes been adopted in Scotland, and the arms of Hay are an
  instance. It usually in British heraldry is used to carry the arms of an
  heiress wife, but both these points will be dealt with later under the
  subject of marshalling. The inescutcheon, no matter what its position,
  should never be termed an escutcheon of pretence if it forms a charge
  upon the original arms. A curious instance of the use of an inescutcheon
  will be found in the arms of Gordon-Cumming (Plate III.).</p>

  <p>When an inescutcheon appears on a shield it should conform in its
  outline to the shape of the shield upon which it is placed.</p>

<h5>THE BORDURE</h5>

  <p>The bordure (Fig. 210) occurs both as a charge and as a mark of
  difference. As may be presumed from its likeness to our word border, the
  bordure is simply a border round the shield. Except in modern grants in
  which the bordure forms a part of the original design of the arms, there
  can be very little doubt that the bordure has always been a mark of
  difference to indicate either cadency or bastardy, but its stereotyped
  continuance without further alteration in so many coats of arms in which
  it originally was introduced as a difference, and also its appearance in
  new grants, leave one no alternative but to treat of it in the ordinary
  way as a charge, leaving the consideration of it as a mark of difference
  to a future chapter.</p>

  <p>There is no stereotyped or official size for the bordure, the width of
  which has at all times varied, though it will almost invariably be found
  that a Scottish bordure is depicted rather wider than is an English one;
  and naturally a bordure which is charged is a little wider than an
  entirely plain one. The bordure of course is subject to <!-- Page 139
  --><span class="pagenum" title="165.png"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>all the lines of partition (Figs.
  211-218). Bordures may also be per fesse, per pale (Fig. 219), quarterly
  (Fig. 220), gyronny (Fig. 221), or tierced in pairle (Fig. 222),
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The bordure has long since ceased to be a mark of cadency in England,
  but as a mark of distinction the bordure wavy (Fig. 215) is still used to
  indicate bastardy. A bordure of England was granted by Royal warrant as
  an augmentation to H.M. Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain, on the occasion
  of her marriage. The use of the bordure is, however, the recognised
  method of differencing in Scotland, but it is curious that with the Scots
  the bordure wavy is in no way a mark of illegitimacy. The Scottish
  bordure for indicating this fact is <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="166.png"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>the
  bordure compony (Fig. 223), which has been used occasionally for the same
  purpose in England, but the bordures added to indicate cadency and the
  various marks to indicate illegitimacy will be discussed in later
  chapters. The difference should here be observed between the bordure
  compony (Fig. 223), which means illegitimacy; the bordure counter compony
  (Fig. 224), which may or may not have that meaning; and the bordure
  chequy (Fig. 225), which certainly has no relation to bastardy. In the
  two former the panes run with the shield, in the latter the chequers do
  not. Whilst the bordure as a mark of cadency or illegitimacy surrounds
  the whole shield, being superimposed upon even the chief and canton, a
  bordure when merely a charge gives way to both.</p>

  <p>A certain rule regarding the bordure is the sole remaining instance in
  modern heraldry of the formerly recognised practice of conjoining two
  coats of arms (which it might be necessary to marshal together) by
  "dimidiation" instead of using our present-day method of impalement. To
  dimidiate two coats of arms, the dexter half of one shield was conjoined
  to the sinister half of the other. The objections to such a practice,
  however, soon made themselves apparent (<i>e.g.</i> a dimidiated chevron
  was scarcely distinguishable from a bend), and the "dimidiation" of arms
  was quickly abandoned in favour of <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum" title="167.png"
  ><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span>"impalement," in which the entire
  designs of both coats of arms are depicted. But in impaling a coat of
  arms which is surrounded by a bordure, the bordure is not continued down
  the centre between the two coats, but stops short top and bottom at the
  palar line. The same rule, by the way, applies to the tressure, but not
  to the orle. The curious fact, however, remains that this rule as to the
  dimidiation of the bordure in cases of impalement is often found to have
  been ignored in ancient seals and other examples. The charges upon the
  bordure are often three, but more usually eight in number, in the latter
  case being arranged three along the top of the shield, one at the base
  point, and two on either side. The number should, however, always be
  specified, unless (as in a bordure bezantée, &amp;c.) it is immaterial;
  in which case the number eight must be <i>exceeded</i> in emblazoning the
  shield. The rule as to colour upon colour does not hold and seems often
  to be ignored in the cases of bordures, noticeably when these occur as
  marks of Scottish cadency.</p>

<h5>THE ORLE</h5>

  <p>The orle (Fig. 226), or, as it was originally termed in ancient
  British rolls of arms, "un faux ecusson," is a narrow bordure following
  the exact outline of the shield, but within it, showing the field (for at
  least the width usually occupied by a bordure) between the outer edge of
  the orle and the edge of the escutcheon. An orle is about half the width
  of a bordure, rather less than more, but the proportion is never very
  exactly maintained. The difference may be noted between this figure and
  the next (Fig. 227), which shows an inescutcheon within a bordure.</p>

  <p>Though both forms are very seldom so met with, an orle may be subject
  to the usual lines of partition, and may also be charged. Examples of
  both these variations are met with in the arms of Yeatman-Biggs, and the
  arms of Gladstone afford an instance of an orle "flory." The arms of
  Knox, Earl of Ranfurly, are: Gules, a falcon volant or, within an orle
  wavy on the outer and engrailed on the inner edge argent.</p>

  <p>When a series of charges are placed round the edges of the <!-- Page
  142 --><span class="pagenum" title="168.png"><a
  name="page142"></a>{142}</span>escutcheon (<i>theoretically</i> in the
  position occupied by the orle, but as a matter of actual fact usually
  more in the position occupied by the bordure), they are said to be "in
  orle," which is the correct term, but they will often be found blazoned
  "an orle of (<i>e.g.</i>) martlets or mounds."</p>

<h5>THE TRESSURE</h5>

  <p>The tressure is really an orle gemel, <i>i.e.</i> an orle divided into
  two narrow ones set closely together, the one inside the other. It is,
  however, usually depicted a trifle nearer the edge of the escutcheon than
  the orle is generally placed.</p>

  <p>The tressure cannot be borne singly, as it would then be an orle, but
  plain tressures under the name of "concentric orles" will be found
  mentioned in Papworth. In that Ordinary eight instances are given of arms
  containing more than a single orle, though the eight instances are
  plainly varieties of only four coats. Two concentric orles would
  certainly be a tressure, save that perhaps they would be drawn of rather
  too great a width for the term "tressure" to be properly applied to
  them.</p>

    228.</span>&mdash;Tressure flory and counter-flory.</p>
  </div>

  <p>If these instances be disregarded, and I am inclined to doubt them as
  genuine coats, there certainly is no example of a plain tressure in
  British heraldry, and one's attention must be directed to the tressure
  flory and counterflory (Fig. 228), so general in Scottish heraldry.</p>

  <p>Originating entirely in the Royal escutcheon, one cannot do better
  than reproduce the remarks of Lyon King of Arms upon the subject from his
  work "Heraldry in relation to Scottish History and Art":&mdash;</p>

  <p>"William the Lion has popularly got the credit of being the first to
  introduce heraldic bearings into Scotland, and to have assumed the lion
  as his personal cognisance. The latter statement may or may not be true,
  but we have no trace of hereditary arms in Scotland so early as his reign
  (1165-1214). Certainly the lion does not appear on his seal, but it does
  on that of his son and successor Alexander II., with apparent remains of
  the double tressure flory counterflory, a device which is clearly seen on
  the seals of Alexander III. (1249-1285). We are unable to say what the
  reason was for the adoption of such a distinctive coat; of course, if you
  turn to the older writers you will find all sorts of fables on the
  subject. Even the sober and sensible Nisbet states that 'the lion has
  been carried on the armorial ensign of <!-- Page 143 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="169.png"><a
  name="page143"></a>{143}</span>Scotland since the first founding of the
  monarchy by King Fergus I.'&mdash;a very mythical personage, who is said
  to have flourished about 300 <span class="sm">B.C.</span>, though he is
  careful to say that he does not believe arms are as old as that period.
  He says, however, that it is 'without doubt' that Charlemagne entered
  into an alliance with Achaius, King of Scotland, and for the services of
  the Scots the French king added to the Scottish lion the double tressure
  fleur-de-lisée to show that the former had defended the French lilies,
  and that therefore the latter would surround the lion and be a defence to
  him."</p>

  <p>All this is very pretty, but it is not history. Chalmers remarks in
  his "Caledonia" that the lion may possibly have been derived from the
  arms of the old Earls of Northumberland and Huntingdon, from whom some of
  the Scottish kings were descended; and he mentions an old roll of arms
  preserved by Leland,<a name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
  which is certainly not later than 1272, in which the arms of Scotland are
  blazoned as: <i>Or, a lion gules within a bordure or fleuretté gules</i>,
  which we may reasonably interpret as an early indication of what may be
  considered as a foreign rendering of the double tressure. Sylvanus
  Morgan, one of the very maddest of the seventeenth-century heraldic
  writers, says that the tressure was added to the shield of Scotland, in
  testimony of a league between Scotland and France, by Charles V.; but
  that king did not ascend the throne of France till 1364, at which time we
  have clear proof that the tressure was a firmly established part of the
  Scottish arms. One of the earliest instances of anything approaching the
  tressure in the Scottish arms which I have met with is in an armorial of
  Matthew Paris, which is now in the Cottonian MSS. in the British Museum,
  and at one time belonged to St. Alban's Monastery. Here the arms of the
  King of Scotland are given as: "Or, a lion rampant flory gules in a
  bordure of the same." The drawing represents a lion within a bordure, the
  latter being pierced by ten fleurs-de-lis, their heads all looking
  inwards, the other end not being free, but attached to the inner margin
  of the shield. This, you will observe, is very like the arms I mentioned
  as described by Chalmers, and it may possibly be the same volume which
  may have been acquired by Sir Robert Cotton. In 1471 there was a curious
  attempt of the Scottish Parliament to displace the tressure. An Act was
  passed in that year, for some hitherto unexplained reason, by which it
  was ordained "that in tyme to cum thar suld be na double tresor about his
  (the king's) armys, but that he suld ber hale armys of the lyoun without
  ony mair." Seeing that at the time of this enactment the Scottish kings
  had borne the tressure for upwards of 220 years, it is difficult to
  understand the cause of this procedure. Like many other Acts, however, it
  never seems to have <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum" title="170.png"
  ><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>been carried into effect; at least I
  am not aware of even a solitary instance of the Scottish arms without the
  tressure either at or after this period.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>There are other two representations of the Scottish arms in foreign
  armorials, to which I may briefly allude. One is in the <i>Armorial de
  Gelre</i>, a beautiful MS. in the Royal Library at Brussels, the Scottish
  shields in which have been figured by Mr. Stodart in his book on Scottish
  arms, and, more accurately, by Sir Archibald Dunbar in a paper read to
  the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1890. The armorial is believed
  to be the work of Claes Heynen, Gelre Herald to the Duke of Gueldres
  between 1334 and 1372, with later additions by another hand. The coat
  assigned in it to the King of Scotland is the lion and double tressure;
  the lion is uncrowned, and is armed and langued azure; above the shield
  is a helmet argent adorned behind with a short capelin or plain mantling,
  on which is emblazoned the saltire and chief of the Bruces, from which we
  may gather that the arms of David II. are here represented; the lining is
  blue, which is unusual, as mantlings are usually lined or doubled with a
  metal, if not with ermine. The helmet is surmounted by an Imperial crown,
  with a dark green bonnet spotted with red.<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> On the crown there is the crest of a
  lion sejant guardant gules, imperially crowned or, holding in his paw a
  sword upright; the tail is coué or placed between the hind-legs of the
  lion, but it then rises up and flourishes high above his back in a
  sufficiently defiant fashion. This shows that the Scottish arms were well
  known on the Continent of Europe nearly a hundred years before the date
  of the Grunenberg MS., while Virgil de Solis (c. 1555) gives a
  sufficiently accurate representation of the Royal shield, though the
  fleur-de-lis all project outwards as in the case of Grunenberg; he gives
  the crest as a lion rampant holding a sword in bend over his shoulder.
  Another ancient representation of the Scottish arms occurs in a MS.
  treatise on heraldry of the sixteenth century, containing the coats of
  some foreign sovereigns and other personages, bound up with a Scottish
  armorial, probably by David Lindsay, Lyon in 1568.</p>

  <p>The tressure, like the bordure, in the case of an impalement stops at
  the line of impalement, as will be seen by a reference to the arms of
  Queen Anne after the union of the crowns of England and Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is now held, both in England and Scotland, that the tressure flory
  and counterflory is, as a part of the Royal Arms, protected, and cannot
  be granted to any person without the express licence of the <!-- Page 145
  --><span class="pagenum" title="171.png"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>Sovereign. This, however, does not
  interfere with the matriculation or exemplification of it in the case of
  existing arms in which it occurs.</p>

  <p>Many Scottish families bear or claim to bear the Royal tressure by
  reason of female descent from the Royal House, but it would seem much
  more probable that in most if not in all cases where it is so borne by
  right its origin is due rather to a gift by way of augmentation than to
  any supposed right of inheritance. The apparently conflicting statements
  of origin are not really antagonistic, inasmuch as it will be seen from
  many analogous English instances (<i>e.g.</i> Mowbray, Manners, and
  Seymour) that near relationship is often the only reason to account for
  the grant of a Royal augmentation. As an ordinary augmentation of honour
  it has been frequently granted.</p>

  <p>The towns of Aberdeen and Perth obtained early the right of honouring
  their arms with the addition of the Royal tressure. It appears on the
  still existing matrix of the burgh seal of Aberdeen, which was engraved
  in 1430.</p>

  <p>James V. in 1542 granted a warrant to Lyon to surround the arms of
  John Scot, of Thirlestane, with the Royal tressure, in respect of his
  ready services at Soutra Edge with three score and ten lances on
  horseback, when other nobles refused to follow their Sovereign. The grant
  was put on record by the grantee's descendant, Patrick, Lord <span
  class="sc">Napier</span>, and is the tressured coat borne in the second
  and third quarters of the <span class="sc">Napier</span> arms.</p>

  <p>When the Royal tressure is granted to the bearer of a quartered coat
  it is usually placed upon a bordure surrounding the quartered shield, as
  in the case of the arms of the Marquess of <span
  class="sc">Queensberry</span>, to whom, in 1682, the Royal tressure was
  granted upon a <i>bordure or</i>. A like arrangement is borne by the
  Earls of <span class="sc">Eglinton</span>, occurring as far back as a
  seal of Earl <span class="sc">Hugh</span>, appended to a charter of
  1598.</p>

  <p>The Royal tressure had at least twice been granted as an augmentation
  to the arms of foreigners. James V. granted it to Nicolas <span
  class="sc">Canivet</span> of Dieppe, secretary to <span
  class="sc">John</span>, Duke of <span class="sc">Albany</span> (Reg. Mag.
  Sig., xxiv. 263, Oct. 24, 1529). James VI. gave it to Sir <span
  class="sc">Jacob Van Eiden</span>, a Dutchman on whom he conferred the
  honour of knighthood.</p>

  <p>On 12th March 1762, a Royal Warrant was granted directing Lyon to add
  a "double tressure counterflowered as in the Royal arms of Scotland" to
  the arms of <span class="sc">Archibald</span>, Viscount <span
  class="sc">Primrose</span>. Here the tressure was <i>gules</i>, as in the
  Royal arms, although the field on which it was placed was <i>vert</i>. In
  a later record of the arms of <span class="sc">Archibald</span>, Earl of
  <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>, in 1823, this heraldic anomaly was
  brought to an end, and the blazon of the arms of Primrose is now: "Vert,
  three primroses within a double tressure flory counterflory or." (See
  Stodart, "Scottish Arms," vol. i. pp. 262, 263, where mention is also
  made of an older <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum" title="172.png"
  ><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span>use of the Royal tressure or, by
  "<span class="sc">Archbald Primrose</span> of Dalmenie, Knight and
  baronet, be his majesty <span class="sc">Charles</span> ii. create,
  <i>Vert, three primroses within a double tressure flowered
  counter-flowered or</i>.") Another well-known Scottish instance in which
  the tressure occurs will be found in the arms of the Marquess of Ailsa
  (Fig. 229).</p>

  <p>Two instances are known in which the decoration of the tressure has
  differed from the usual conventional fleurs-de-lis. The tressure granted
  to Charles, Earl of Aboyne, has crescents without and demi-fleurs-de-lis
  within, and the tressure round the Gordon arms in the case of the Earls
  of Aberdeen is of thistles, roses, and fleurs-de-lis alternately.</p>

  <p>The tressure gives way to the chief and canton, but all other
  ordinaries are enclosed by the tressure, as will be seen from the arms of
  Lord Ailsa.</p>

<h5>THE LOZENGE, THE FUSIL, THE MASCLE, AND THE RUSTRE</h5>

  <p>Why these, which are simply varying forms of one charge, should ever
  have been included amongst the list of ordinaries is difficult to
  understand, as they do not seem to be "ordinaries" any more than say the
  mullet or the crescent. My own opinion is that they are no more than
  distinctively heraldic charges. The <i>lozenge</i> (Fig. 230), which is
  the original form, is the same shape as the "diamond" in a pack of cards,
  and will constantly be found as a charge. In addition to this, the arms
  of a lady as maid, or as widow, are always displayed upon a lozenge. Upon
  this point reference should be made to the chapters upon marshalling. The
  arms of Kyrke show a single lozenge as the charge, but a single lozenge
  is very rarely met with. The arms of Guise show seven lozenges conjoined.
  The arms of Barnes show four lozenges conjoined in cross, and the arms of
  Bartlett show five lozenges conjoined in fess. Although the lozenge is
  very seldom found in English armory as a single charge, nevertheless as a
  lozenge throughout (that is, with its four points touching the borders of
  the escutcheon) it will be found in some number of instances in
  Continental heraldry, for instance in the family of Eubing of Bavaria. An
  indefinite number of lozenges conjoined as a bend or a pale are known as
  a bend lozengy, or a pale lozengy, but care should be taken in using this
  term, as it is possible for these ordinaries to be plain <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum" title="175.png"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span>ordinaries tinctured "lozengy of two
  colours." The arms of Bolding are an example of a bend lozengy.</p>

  <p>The <i>fusil</i> is supposed to be, and is generally depicted, of a
  greater height and less width than a lozenge, being an altogether
  narrower figure (Fig. 231). Though this distinction is generally
  observed, it is not always easy to decide which figure any emblazonment
  is intended to represent, unless the blazon of the arms in question is
  known. In many cases the variations of different coats of arms, to suit
  or to fit the varying shapes of shields, have resulted in the use of
  lozenges and fusils indifferently. Fusils occur in the historic arms of
  Daubeney, from which family Daubeney of Cote, near Bristol, is descended,
  being one of the few families who have an undoubted male descent from a
  companion of William the Conqueror. In the ordinary way five or more
  lozenges in fess would be fusils, as in the arms of Percy, Duke of
  Northumberland, who bears in the first quarter: Azure, five fusils
  conjoined in fess or. The charges in the arms of Montagu, though only
  three in number, are always termed fusils. But obviously in early times
  there could have been no distinction between the lozenge and the
  fusil.</p>

  <p>The <i>mascle</i> is a lozenge voided, <i>i.e.</i> only the outer
  framework is left, the inner portion being removed (Fig. 232). Mascles
  have no particular or special meaning, but are frequently to be met
  with.</p>

  <p>The blazon of the arms of De Quincy in Charles's Roll is: "De goules
  poudré a fause losengez dor," and in another Roll (MS. Brit. Mus. 29,796)
  the arms are described: "De gules a set fauses lozenges de or" (Fig.
  234). The great Seiher de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, father of Roger,
  bore quite different arms (Fig. 235). In 1472 Louis de Bruges, Lord of
  Gruthuyse, was created Earl of Winchester, having no relation to the De
  Quincy line. The arms of De Bruges, or rather of Gruthuyse, were very
  different, yet nevertheless, we find upon the Patent Roll (12 Edward IV.
  pt. 1, <i>m.</i> 11) a grant of the following arms: "Azure, dix mascles
  d'Or, enormé d'une canton de nostre propre Armes de Angleterre; cest a
  savoir de Gules a une Lipard passant d'Or, armée <!-- Page 148 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="176.png"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>d'Azure," to Louis, Earl of Winchester
  (Fig. 236). The recurrence of the mascles in the arms of the successive
  Earls of Winchester, whilst each had other family arms, and in the arms
  of Ferrers, whilst not being the original Ferrers coat, suggests the
  thought that there may be hidden some reference to a common saintly
  patronage which all enjoyed, or some territorial honour common to the
  three of which the knowledge no longer remains with us.</p>

  <p>There are some number of coats which are said to have had a field
  masculy. Of course this is quite possible, and the difference between a
  field masculy and a field fretty is that in the latter the separate
  pieces of which it is composed interlace each other; but when the field
  is masculy it is all one fretwork surface, the field being visible
  through the voided apertures. Nevertheless it seems by no means certain
  that in every case in which the field masculy occurs it may not be found
  in other, and possibly earlier, examples as fretty. At any rate, very few
  such coats of arms are even supposed to exist. The arms of De Burgh (Fig.
  237) are blazoned in the Grimaldi Roll: "Masclee de vêre and de goules,"
  but whether the inference is that this blazon is wrong or that lozenge
  and mascle were identical terms I am not aware.</p>

  <p>The <i>rustre</i> is comparatively rare (Fig. 233). It is a lozenge
  pierced in the centre with a circular hole. It occurs in the arms of J.
  D. G. Dalrymple, Esq., F.S.A. Some few coats of arms are mentioned in
  Papworth in which the rustre appears; for example the arms of Pery, which
  are: "Or, three rustres sable;" and Goodchief, which are: "Per fess or
  and sable, three rustres counterchanged;" but so seldom is the figure met
  with that it may be almost dropped out of consideration. How it ever
  reached the position of being considered one of the ordinaries has always
  been to me a profound mystery. <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum" title="177.png"

<h5>THE FRET</h5>

  <p>The fret (Fig. 238), which is very frequently found occurring in
  British armory, is no doubt derived from earlier coats of arms, the whole
  field of which was covered by an interlacing of alternate bendlets and
  bendlets sinister, because many of the families who now bear a simple
  fret are found in earlier representations and in the early rolls of arms
  bearing coats which were fretty (Fig. 239). Instances of this kind will
  be found in the arms of Maltravers, Verdon, Tollemache, and other
  families.</p>

    of John Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel (<i>d.</i> 1435): Quarterly, 1 and
    4, gules, a lion rampant or (for Fitz Alan); 2 and 3, sable, fretty or
    (for Maltravers). (From his seal, <i>c.</i> 1432.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Sable fretty or" was the original form of the arms of the ancient and
  historic family of Maltravers. At a later date the arms of Maltravers are
  found simply "sable, a fret or," but, like the arms of so many other
  families which we now find blazoned simply as charged with a fret, their
  original form was undoubtedly "fretty." They appear fretty as late as in
  the year 1421, which is the date at which the Garter plate of Sir William
  Arundel, K.G. (1395-1400), was set up in St. George's Chapel at Windsor.
  His arms as there displayed are in the first and fourth quarters, "gules,
  a lion rampant or," and in the second and third, "purpure fretty or" for
  Maltravers. Probably the seal of John Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel
  (<i>d.</i> 1435), roughly marks the period, and shows the source of the
  confusion (Fig. 240). But it should be noted that Sir Richard Arundel,
  Lord Maltravers, bore at the siege of Rouen, in the year 1418, gules a
  lion rampant or, quarterly with "sable a fret or" (for Maltravers). This
  would seem to indicate <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum" title="178.png"
  ><a name="page150"></a>{150}</span>that those who treat the fret and
  fretty as interchangeable have good grounds for so doing. A Sir John
  Maltravers bore "sable fretty or" at the siege of Calais, and another Sir
  John Maltravers, a knight banneret, bore at the first Dunstable
  tournament "sable fretty or, a label of three points argent." As he is
  there described as Le Fitz, the label was probably a purely temporary
  mark of difference. In a roll of arms which is believed to belong to the
  latter part of the reign of Henry III., a Sir William Maltravers is
  credited with "sable fretty or, on a quarter argent, three lions passant
  in pale gules." The palpable origin of the fret or fretty in the case of
  the arms of Maltravers is simply the canting similarity between a
  traverse and the name Maltravers. Another case, which starting fretty has
  ended in a fret, occurs in the arms of the family of Harington. Sir John
  de Haverington, or Sir John de Harington, is found at the first Dunstable
  tournament in 1308 bearing "sable fretty argent," and this coat of arms
  variously differenced appears in some number of the other early rolls of
  arms. The Harington family, as may be seen from the current baronetages,
  now bear "sable a fret argent," but there can be little doubt that in
  this case the origin of the fretty is to be found in a representation of
  a herring-net.</p>

  <p>The fret is usually depicted <i>throughout</i> when borne singly, and
  is then composed of a bendlet dexter and a bendlet sinister, interlaced
  in the centre by a mascle. Occasionally it will be found couped, but it
  is then, as a rule, only occupying the position of a subsidiary charge. A
  coat which is <i>fretty</i> is entirely covered by the interlacing
  bendlets and bendlets sinister, no mascles being introduced.</p>

<h5>THE FLAUNCH</h5>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig241.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig241.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    241.</span>&mdash;Flaunches.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The flaunch, which is never borne singly, and for which the additional
  names of "flasks" and "voiders" are sometimes found, is the segment of a
  circle of large diameter projecting into the field from either side of
  the escutcheon, of a different colour from the field. It is by no means
  an unusual charge to be met with, and, like the majority of other
  ordinaries, is subject to the usual lines of partition, but so subject
  is, however, of rather rare occurrence.</p>

  <p>Planché, in his "Pursuivant of Arms," mentions the old idea, which is
  repeated by Woodward, "that the base son of a noble woman, if he doe gev
  armes, must give upon the same a surcoat, but unless you do <!-- Page 151
  --><span class="pagenum" title="179.png"><a

  coat flanchette." The surcoat is much the same figure that would remain
  after flaunches had been taken from the field of a shield, with this
  exception, that the flaunches would be wider and the intervening space
  necessarily much narrower. In spite of the fact that this is supposed to
  be one of the recognised rules of armory, one instance only appears to be
  known of its employment, which, however, considering the circumstances,
  is not very much to be wondered at. One exceptional case surely cannot
  make a rule. I know of no modern case of a mother's coat
  bastardised&mdash;but I assume it would fall under the ordinary practice
  of the bordure wavy.</p>

<h5>THE ROUNDLE</h5>

  <p>The roundle is a generic name which comprises all charges which are
  plain circular figures of colour or metal. Foreign heraldry merely terms
  them roundles of such and such a colour, but in England we have special
  terms for each tincture.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    243.</span>&mdash;The Arms of Stourton.</p>
  </div>

  <p>When the roundle is gold it is termed a "bezant," when silver a
  "plate," when gules a "torteau," when azure a "hurt," when sable an
  "ogress," "pellet," or "gunstone," when vert a "pomeis," when purpure a
  "golpe," when tenné an "orange," when sanguine a "guze." The golpes,
  oranges, and guzes are seldom, if ever, met with, but the others are of
  constant occurrence, and roundles of fur are by no means unknown. A
  roundle of more than one colour is described as a roundle "per pale," for
  example of gules and azure, or whatever it may be. The plates and bezants
  are naturally flat, and must be so represented. They should never be
  shaded up into a globular form. The torteau is sometimes found shaded,
  but is more correctly flat, but probably the pellet or ogress and the
  pomeis are intended to be globular. Roundles of fur are always flat. One
  curious roundle is a very common charge in British armory, that is, the
  "fountain," which is a roundle barry wavy argent and azure (Fig. 242).
  This is the conventional heraldic representation of water, of course. A
  fountain will be found termed a "syke" when occurring in the arms of any
  family of the name of Sykes. It <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum" title="180.png"
  ><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>typifies naturally anything in the
  nature of a well, in which meaning it occurs on the arms of Stourton
  (Fig. 243).</p>

  <p>The arms of Stourton are one of the few really ancient coats
  concerning which a genuine explanation exists. The blazon of them is:
  Sable a bend or, between six fountains proper. Concerning this coat of
  arms Aubrey says: "I believe anciently 'twas only Sable a bend or." With
  all deference to Aubrey, I personally neither think he was right, nor do
  I pay much attention to his <i>opinions</i>, particularly in this case,
  inasmuch as every known record of the Stourton arms introduces the six
  fountains. The name Stourton, originally "de Stourton," is emphatically a
  territorial name, and there is little opportunity for this being
  gainsaid, inasmuch as the lordship and manor of Stourton, in the counties
  of Wilts and Somerset, remained in the possession of the Lords Stourton
  until the year 1714. The present Lord Mowbray and Stourton still owns
  land within the parish. Consequently there is no doubt whatever that the
  Lords Stourton derived their surname from this manor of Stourton. Equally
  is it certain that the manor of Stourton obtained its name from the river
  Stour, which rises within the manor. The sources of the river Stour are
  six wells, which exist in a tiny valley in Stourton Park, which to this
  day is known by the name of "The Six Wells Bottom." In the present year
  of grace only one of the six wells remains visible. When Sir Richard Colt
  Hoare wrote, there were four visible. Of these four, three were outside
  and one inside the park wall. The other two within the park had been then
  closed up. When Leland wrote in 1540 to 1542, the six wells were in
  existence and visible; for he wrote: "The ryver of Stoure risith ther of
  six fountaynes or springes, whereof 3 be on the northe side of the Parke,
  harde withyn the Pale, the other 3 be north also, but withoute the Parke.
  The Lorde Stourton giveth these 6 fountaynes yn his Armes." Guillim says
  the same thing: "These six Fountains are borne in signification of six
  Springs, whereof the River of Sture in Wiltshire hath his beginning, and
  passeth along to Sturton, the seat of that Barony." Here, then, is the
  origin of the six fountains upon the coat of arms; but Aubrey remarks
  that three of the six springs in the park are in the county of Wilts,
  whereas Mr. Camden has put them all in Somersetshire. However, the fact
  is that three of the springs were inside the park and three outside, and
  that three were in Wiltshire and three in Somersetshire. Here, then, is
  to be found the division upon the coat of arms of the six fountains in
  the two sets of three each, and it is by no means an improbable
  suggestion that the bend which separates the three from the three is
  typical of, or was suggested by, either the park wall or pale, or by the
  line of division between the two counties, and the more probable of the
  two seems to <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum" title="181.png"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span>be the park wall. The coat of arms is just
  a map of the property. Now, with regard to the arms, as far as is known
  there has not been at any time the slightest deviation by the family of
  the Lords Stourton from the coat quoted and illustrated. But before
  leaving the subject it may be well to point out that in the few cases in
  which an ancient coat of arms carries with it an explanation, such
  explanation is usually to be found either in some such manner as that in
  which these arms of Stourton have been explained, or else in some
  palpable pun, and not in the mythical accounts and legends of
  supernatural occurrences which have been handed down, and seldom indeed
  in any explanation of personal nobility which the tinctures or charges
  are sometimes said to represent.</p>

  <p>What is now considered quite a different charge from the fountain is
  the whirlpool or gurges, which is likewise intended to represent water,
  and is borne by a family of the name of Gorges, the design occupying the
  whole of the field. This is represented by a spiral line of azure
  commencing in the centre of an argent field, continuing round and round
  until the edges of the shield are reached; but there can be very little
  doubt that this was an early form of representing the watery roundle
  which happens to have been perpetuated in the instance of that one coat.
  The fountains upon the seal of the first Lord Stourton are represented in
  this manner.</p>

  <p>Examples of a field semé of roundles are very usual, these being
  termed bezanté or platé if semé of bezants or plates; but in the cases of
  roundles of other colours the words "semé of" need to be used.</p>

<h5>THE ANNULET</h5>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig244.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig244.png"
      alt="Fig. 244." title="Fig. 244." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    244.</span>&mdash;Annulet.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Closely akin to the roundel is the annulet (Fig. 244) and though, as
  far as I am aware, no text-book has as yet included this in its list of
  ordinaries and sub-ordinaries, one can see no reason, as the annulet is a
  regularly used heraldic figure, why the lozenge should have been included
  and the annulet excluded, when the annulet is of quite as frequent
  occurrence. It is, as its name implies, simply a plain ring of metal or
  colour, as will be found in the arms of Lowther, Hutton, and many other
  families. Annulets appear anciently to have been termed false
  roundles.</p>

  <p>Annulets will frequently be found interlaced. <!-- Page 154 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="182.png"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>Care
  should be taken to distinguish them from gem-rings, which are always
  drawn in a very natural manner with stones, which, however, in real life
  would approach an impossible size.</p>

<h5>THE LABEL</h5>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig245.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig245.png"
      alt="Fig. 245." title="Fig. 245." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    245.</span>&mdash;The Label.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The label (Fig. 245) as a charge must be distinguished from the label
  as a mark of difference for the eldest son, though there is no doubt that
  in those cases in which it now exists as a charge, the origin must be
  traced to its earlier use as a difference. Concerning its use as a mark
  of difference it will be treated of further in the chapter upon marks of
  difference and cadency, but as a charge it will seldom be found in any
  position except in chief, and not often of other than three points, and
  it will always be found drawn throughout, that is, with the upper line
  extended to the size of the field. It consists of a narrow band straight
  across the shield, from which depend at right angles three short bands.
  These shorter arms have each of late years been drawn more in the shape
  of a dovetail, but this was not the case until a comparatively recent
  period, and now-a-days we are quite as inclined to revert to the old
  forms as to perpetuate this modern variety. Other names for the label are
  the "lambel" and the "file." The label is the only mark of difference now
  borne by the Royal Family. Every member of the Royal Family has the Royal
  arms assigned to him for use presumably during life, and in these
  warrants, which are separate and personal for each individual, both the
  coronet and the difference marks which are to be borne upon the label are
  quoted and assigned. This use of the label, however, will be subsequently
  fully dealt with. As a charge, the label occurs in the arms of
  Barrington: "Argent, three chevronels gules, a label azure;" and
  Babington: "Argent, ten torteaux, four, three, two, and one, in chief a
  label of three points azure;" also in the earlier form of the arms of De
  Quincy (Fig. 235) and Courtenay (Fig. 246). Various curious coats of arms
  in which the label appears are given in Papworth as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"... a label of four points in bend sinister ... Wm. de Curli, 20th
  Hen. III. (Cotton, Julius F., vii. 175.)</p>

  <p>"Argent, a label of five points azure. Henlington, co. Gloucester.
  (Harl. MS. 1404, fo. 109.)</p>

  <p>"Or, a file gules, with three bells pendent azure, clappers sable.
  (Belfile.) <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum" title="183.png"><a
  name="page155"></a>{155}</span></p>

  <p>"Sable, three crescents, in chief a label of two drops and in fess
  another of one drop argent. Fitz-Simons. (Harl. MS. 1441 and 5866.)</p>

  <p>"Or, three files borne barways gules, the first having five points,
  the second four, and the last three. Liskirke, Holland. (Gwillim.)"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A curious label will have been noticed in the arms of De Valence (Fig.
  120).</p>

<h5>THE BILLET</h5>

  <p>The billet (Fig. 247), though not often met with as a charge, does
  sometimes occur, as for example, in the arms of Alington.</p>

  <p>Its more frequent appearance is as an object with which a field or
  superior charge is semé, in which case these are termed billetté (Fig.
  248). The best known instance of this is probably the coat borne on an
  inescutcheon over the arms of England during the joint reign of William
  and Mary. The arms of Gasceline afford another example of a field
  billetté. These are "or, billetté azure, and a label gules." Though not
  many instances are given under each subdivision, Papworth affords
  examples of coats with every number of billets from 1 to 20, but many of
  them, particularly some of those from 10 to 20 in number, are merely
  mistaken renderings of fields which should have been termed billetté. The
  billet, slightly widened, is sometimes known as a block, and as such will
  be found in the arms of Paynter. Other instances are to be found where
  the billets are termed delves or gads. The billet will sometimes be found
  pointed at the bottom, in which case it is termed "urdy at the foot." But
  neither as a form of semé, nor as a charge, is the billet of sufficiently
  frequent use to warrant its inclusion as one of the ordinaries or
  sub-ordinaries. <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum" title="184.png"><a

<h5>THE CHAPLET</h5>

  <p>Why the chaplet was ever included amongst the ordinaries and
  sub-ordinaries passes my comprehension. It is not of frequent occurrence,
  and I have yet to ascertain in which form it has acquired this status.
  The chaplet which is usually meant when the term is employed is the
  garland of oak, laurel, or other leaves or flowers (Fig. 249), which is
  found more frequently as part of a crest. There is also the chaplet,
  which it is difficult to describe, save as a large broad annulet <!--
  Page 157 --><span class="pagenum" title="185.png"><a
  name="page157"></a>{157}</span>such as the one which figures in the arms
  of Nairne (Fig. 250), and which is charged at four regular intervals with
  roses, mullets, or some other objects.</p>

  <p>The chaplet of oak and acorns is sometimes known as a civic crown, but
  the term chaplet will more frequently be found giving place to the use of
  the word wreath, and a chaplet of laurel or roses, unless completely
  conjoined and figuring as a charge upon the shield, will be far more
  likely to be termed a wreath or garland of laurel or roses than a
  chaplet.</p>

  <p>There are many other charges which have no great distinction from some
  of these which have been enumerated, but as nobody hitherto has classed
  them as ordinaries I suppose there could be no excuse for so introducing
  them, but the division of any heraldic charges into ordinaries and
  sub-ordinaries, and their separation from other figures, seems to a
  certain extent incomprehensible and very unnecessary. <!-- Page 158

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER X</h5>

<h5>THE HUMAN FIGURE IN HERALDRY</h5>

  <p>If we include the many instances of the human head and the human
  figure which exist as crests, and also the human figure as a supporter,
  probably it or its parts will be nearly as frequently met with in armory
  as the lion; but if crests and supporters be disregarded, and the human
  figure be simply considered as a charge upon the shield, it is by no
  means often to be met with.</p>

  <p>English (but not Scottish) official heraldry now and for a long time
  past has set its face against the representation of any specific saint or
  other person in armorial bearings. In many cases, however, particularly
  in the arms of ecclesiastical sees and towns, the armorial bearings
  registered are simply the conventionalised heraldic representation of
  seal designs dating from a very much earlier period.</p>

  <p>Seal engravers laboured under no such limitations, and their
  representations were usually of some specific saint or person readily
  recognisable from accompanying objects. Consequently, if it be desirable,
  the identity of a figure in a coat of arms can often be traced in such
  cases by reference to a seal of early date, whilst all the time the
  official coat of arms goes no further than to term the figure that of a
  saint.</p>

  <p>The only representation which will be found in British heraldry of the
  Deity is in the arms of the See of Chichester, which certainly originally
  represented our Lord seated in glory. Whether by intention or
  carelessness, this, however, is now represented and blazoned as: "Azure,
  a Prester [Presbyter] John sitting on a tombstone, in his left hand a
  mound, his right hand extended all or, with a linen mitre on his head,
  and in his mouth a sword proper." Possibly it is a corruption, but I am
  rather inclined to think it is an intentional alteration to avoid the
  necessity of any attempt to pictorially represent the Deity.</p>

  <p>Christ upon the Cross, however, will be found represented in the arms
  of Inverness (Fig. 251). The shield used by the town of Halifax has the
  canting "Holy Face" upon a chequy field. This coat, however, is without
  authority, though it is sufficiently remarkable to quote the blazon in
  full: "Chequy or and azure, a man's face with long hair and bearded and
  dropping blood, and surmounted <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum" title="187.png"
  ><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span>by a halo, all proper; in chief the

    Supporters: dexter, a dromedary; sinister, an elephant, both proper.
    (From a painting by Mr. Graham Johnston in Lyon Register.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>No other instance is known, but, on the other hand, representations of
  the Virgin Mary with her babe are not uncommon. She will be found so
  described in the arms of the Royal Burgh of Banff. The Virgin Mary and
  Child appear also in the arms of the town of Leith, <!-- Page 160
  --><span class="pagenum" title="188.png"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>viz.: "Argent, in a sea proper, an ancient
  galley with two masts, sails furled sable, flagged gules, seated therein
  the Virgin Mary with the Infant Saviour in her arms, and a cloud resting
  over their heads, all also proper."</p>

  <p>The Virgin and Child appear in the crest of Marylebone (Fig. 252), but
  in this case, in accordance with the modern English practice, the
  identity is not alluded to. The true derivation of the name from "St.
  Mary le Bourne" (and not "le bon") is perpetuated in the design of the
  arms.</p>

  <p>A demi-figure of the Virgin is the crest of Rutherglen;<a

  Galloway ["Argent, St. Ninian standing and full-faced proper, clothed
  with a pontifical robe purple, on his head a mitre, and in his dexter
  hand a crosier or"]; and St. Adrian, in the arms of the town of
  Pittenweem ["Azur, in the sea a gallie with her oars in action argent,
  and therein standing the figure of St. Adrian, with long garments close
  girt, and a mytre on his head proper, holding in his sinister hand a
  crosier or. On the stern a flag developed argent, charged with the Royall
  Armes of Scotland, with this word, 'Deo Duce'"].</p>

  <p>Biblical characters of the Old Testament have found favour upon the
  Continent, and the instances quoted by Woodward are too amusing to
  omit:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The families who bear the names of saints, such as <span
  class="sc">St. Andrew</span>, <span class="sc">St. George</span>, <span
  class="sc">St. Michael</span>, have (perhaps not unnaturally) included in
  their arms representation of their family patrons.</p>

  <p>"The Bavarian family of <span class="sc">Reider</span> include in
  their shield the mounted effigy of the good knight <span class="sc">St.
  Martin</span> dividing his cloak with a beggar (date of diploma 1760).
  The figure of the great Apostle of the Gentiles appears in the arms of
  <span class="sc">Von Pauli Joerg</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Jorger</span>, of Austria, similarly make use of St.
  George.</p>

  <p>"Continental Heraldry affords not a few examples of the use of the
  personages of Holy Writ. The <span class="sc">Adamoli</span> of Lombardy
  bear: 'Azure, <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum" title="191.png"><a
  name="page163"></a>{163}</span>the Tree of Life entwined with the
  Serpent, and accosted with our first parents, all proper' (<i>i.e.</i> in
  a state of nature). The addition of a chief of the Empire to this coat
  makes it somewhat incongruous.</p>

  <p>"The family of <span class="sc">Adam</span> in Bavaria improve on
  Sacred History by eliminating <span class="sc">Eve</span>, and by
  representing <span class="sc">Adam</span> as holding the apple in one
  hand, and the serpent wriggling in the other. On the other hand, the
  Spanish family of <span class="sc">Eva</span> apparently consider there
  is a sufficiently transparent allusion to their own name, and to the
  mother of mankind, in the simple bearings: 'Or, on a mount in base an
  apple-tree vert, fructed of the field, and encircled by a serpent of the
  second.'</p>

  <p>"The family of <span class="sc">Abel</span> in Bavaria make the
  patriarch in the attitude of prayer to serve as their crest; while the
  coat itself is: 'Sable, on a square altar argent, a lamb lying surrounded
  by fire and smoke proper.'</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Samson</span> slaying the lion is the subject of the
  arms of the <span class="sc">Vesentina</span> family of Verona. The field
  is gules, and on a terrace in base vert the strong man naked bestrides a
  golden lion and forces its jaws apart. The Polish family of <span
  class="sc">Samson</span> naturally use the same device, but the field is
  azure and the patriarch is decently habited. The <span
  class="sc">Starckens</span> of the Island of <span
  class="sc">Oesel</span> also use the like as <i>armes parlantes</i>; the
  field in this case is or. After these we are hardly surprised to find
  that Daniel in the lions' den is the subject of the arms of the Rhenish
  family of <span class="sc">Daniels</span>, granted late in the eighteenth
  century; the field is azure. The Bolognese <span
  class="sc">Daniels</span> are content to make a less evident allusion to
  the prophet; their arms are: "per fess azure and vert, in chief 'the lion
  of the tribe of Judah' naissant or, holding an open book with the words
  '<span class="sc">Libri Aperti Sunt</span>' (<span
  class="sc">Daniel</span> vii. 10).</p>

  <p>"The Archangel <span class="sc">St. Michael</span> in full armour, as
  conventionally represented, treading beneath his feet the great
  adversary, sable, is the charge on an azure field of the <span
  class="sc">Van Schorel</span> of Antwerp."</p>

  <p>Other instances will be found, as St. Kentigern (who is sometimes said
  to be the same as St. Mungo), and who occurs as the crest of Glasgow:
  "The half-length figure of St. Kentigern affronté, vested and mitred, his
  right hand raised in the act of benediction, and having in his left hand
  a crosier, all proper;" St. Michael, in the arms of Linlithgow: "Azure,
  the figure of the Archangel Michael, with wings expanded, treading on the
  belly of a serpent lying with its tail nowed fesswise in base, all
  argent, the head of which he is piercing through with a spear in his
  dexter hand, and grasping with his sinister an escutcheon charged with
  the Royal Arms of Scotland." The same saint also figures in the arms of
  the city of Brussels; while the family of <span
  class="sc">Mitchell-Carruthers</span> bears as a crest: "St. Michael in
  armour, <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum" title="192.png"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>holding a spear in his dexter hand, the
  face, neck, arms and legs bare, all proper, the wings argent, and hair
  auburn."</p>

  <p>St. Martin occurs in the arms of Dover, and he also figures, as has
  been already stated, on the shield of the Bavarian family of <span
  class="sc">Reider</span>, whilst St. Paul occurs as a charge in the arms
  of the Dutch family of <span class="sc">Von Pauli</span>.</p>

  <p>The arms of the See of Clogher are: "A Bishop in pontifical robes
  seated on his chair of state, and leaning towards the sinister, his left
  hand supporting a crosier, his right pointing to the dexter chief, all
  or, the feet upon a cushion gules, tasselled or."</p>

  <p>A curious crest will be found belonging to the arms of a family of
  Stewart, which is: "A king in his robes, crowned." The arms of the
  Episcopal See of Ross afford another instance of a bishop, together with
  St. Boniface.</p>

  <p>The arms of the town of Queensferry, in Scotland, show an instance of
  a queen. "A king in his robes, and crowned," will be found in the arms of
  Dartmouth ["Gules, the base barry wavy, argent and azure, thereon the
  hulk of a ship, in the centre of which is a king robed and crowned, and
  holding in his sinister hand a sceptre, at each end of the ship a lion
  sejant guardant all or]."</p>

  <p>Allegorical figures, though numerous as supporters, are comparatively
  rare as charges upon a shield; but the arms of the University of
  Melbourne show a representation of the figure of Victory ["Azure, a
  figure intended to represent Victory, robed and attired proper, the
  dexter hand extended holding a wreath of laurel or, between four stars of
  eight points, two in pale and two in fess argent"], which also appears in
  other coats of arms.</p>

  <p>The figure of Truth will be found in the coats of arms for various
  members of the family of Sandeman.</p>

  <p>The bust of Queen Elizabeth was granted by that Queen, as a special
  mark of her Royal favour, to Sir Anthony Weldon, her Clerk of the
  Spicery.</p>

  <p>Apollo is represented in the arms of the Apothecaries' Company:
  "Azure, Apollo, the inventor of physic, proper, with his head radiant,
  holding in his left hand a bow and in his right hand an arrow or,
  supplanting a serpent argent."</p>

  <p>The figure of Justice appears in the arms of Wiergman [or
  Wergman].</p>

  <p>Neptune appears in the arms granted to Sir Isaac Heard, Lancaster
  Herald, afterwards Garter King of Arms, and is again to be found in the
  crest of the arms of Monneypenny ["On a dolphin embowed, a bridled
  Neptune astride, holding with his sinister hand a trident over his
  shoulder"].</p>

  <p>The figure of Temperance occurs in the crest of Goodfellow. <!-- Page
  165 --><span class="pagenum" title="193.png"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span></p>

  <p>The head of St. John the Baptist in a charger figures in the crest of
  the Tallow Chandlers' Livery Company and in the arms of Ayr, whilst the
  head of St. Denis is the charge upon the arms of a family of that
  name.</p>

  <p>Angels, though very frequently met with as supporters, are far from
  being usual, either as a charge upon a shield or as a crest. The crest of
  Leslie, however, is an angel.</p>

  <p>The crest of Lord Kintore is an angel in a praying posture or, within
  an orle of laurel proper.</p>

  <p>Cherubs are far more frequently to be met with. They are represented
  in various forms, and will be found in the arms of Chaloner, Thackeray,
  Maddocks, and in the crest of Carruthers.</p>

  <p>The nude figure is perhaps the most usual form in which the human
  being is made use of as a charge, and examples will be found in the arms
  of Wood (Lord Halifax), and in the arms of Oswald.</p>

  <p>The arms of Dalziell show an example&mdash;practically unique in
  British heraldry&mdash;of a naked man, the earliest entry (1685) of the
  arms of Dalziell of Binns (a cadet of the family) in the Lyon Register,
  having them then blazoned: "Sable, a naked man with his arms extended
  <i>au naturel</i>, on a canton argent, a sword and pistol disposed in
  saltire proper."</p>

  <p>This curious coat of arms has been the subject of much speculation.
  The fact that in some early examples the body is swinging from a gibbet
  has led some to suppose the arms to be an allusion to the fact, or
  legend, that one of the family recovered the body of Kenneth III., who
  had suffered death by hanging at the hands of the Picts. But it seems
  more likely that if the gibbet is found in any authoritative versions of
  the arms possibly the coat may owe its origin to a similar reason to that
  which is said, and probably correctly, to account for the curious crest
  of the Davenport family, viz.: "A man's head in profile couped at the
  shoulders proper, about the neck a rope or," or as it is sometimes
  termed, "a felon's head proper, about the neck a halter or." There is now
  in the possession of the Capesthorne branch of the Davenport family a
  long and very ancient roll, containing the names of the master robbers
  captured and beheaded in the times of Koran, Roger, and Thomas de
  Davenport, and probably the Davenport family held some office or Royal
  Commission which empowered them to deal in a summary way with the outlaws
  which infested the Peak country. It is more than probable that the crest
  of Davenport should be traced to some such source as this, and I suggest
  the possibility of a similar origin for the arms of Dalziel.</p>

  <p>As a crest the savage and demi-savage are constantly occurring. <!--
  Page 166 --><span class="pagenum" title="194.png"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>They are in heraldry distinguished by the
  garlands of leaves about either or both loins and temples.</p>

  <p>Men in armour are sometimes met with. The arms of O'Loghlen are an
  instance in point, as are the crests of Marshall, Morse, Bannerman, and
  Seton of Mounie.</p>

  <p>Figures of all nationalities and in all costumes will be found in the
  form of supporters, and occasionally as crests, but it is difficult to
  classify them, and it must suffice to mention a few curious examples. The
  human figure as a supporter is fully dealt with in the chapter devoted to
  that subject.</p>

  <p>The arms of Jedburgh have a mounted warrior, and the same device
  occurs in the crest of the Duke of Fife, and in the arms of
  Lanigan-O'Keefe.</p>

  <p>The arms of Londonderry afford an instance of a skeleton.</p>

  <p>The emblematical figure of Fortune is a very favourite charge in
  foreign heraldry.</p>

  <p>A family of the name of Rodd use the Colossus of Rhodes as a crest:
  and the arms of Sir William Dunn, Bart., are worth the passing mention
  ["Azure, on a mount in base a bale of wool proper, thereon seated a
  female figure representing Commerce, vested argent, resting the dexter
  hand on a stock of an anchor, and in the sinister a caduceus, both or, on
  the chief of the last a tree eradicated, thereon hanging a hunting-horn
  between a thistle slipped proper on the dexter and a fleur-de-lis azure
  on the sinister. Crest: a cornucopia fesswise, surmounted by a dexter
  hand couped proper, holding a key in bend sinister or. Motto: 'Vigilans
  et audax.'"].</p>

  <p>The crests of Vivian ["A demi-hussar of the 18th Regiment, holding in
  his right hand a sabre, and in his left a pennon flying to the sinister
  gules, and inscribed in gold letters, 'Croix d'Orade,' issuant from a
  bridge of one arch, embattled, and at each end a tower"], and Macgregor
  ["two brass guns in saltire in front of a demi-Highlander armed with his
  broadsword, pistols, and with a target, thereon the family arms of
  Macgregor," viz.: "Argent: a sword in bend dexter azure, and an oak-tree
  eradicated in bend sinister proper, in the dexter chief an antique crown
  gules, and upon an escroll surmounting the crest the motto, 'E'en do and
  spare not'"] are typical of many crests of augmentation and
  quasi-augmentation granted in the early part of the nineteenth
  century.</p>

  <p>The crest of the Devonshire family of Arscot ["A demi-man affronté in
  a Turkish habit, brandishing in his dexter hand a scimitar, and his
  sinister hand resting on a tiger's head issuing from the wreath"] is
  curious, as is the crest granted by Sir William Le Neve in 1642 to Sir
  Robert Minshull, viz.: "A Turk kneeling on one knee, habited <!-- Page
  167 --><span class="pagenum" title="195.png"><a
  name="page167"></a>{167}</span>gules, legs and arms in mail proper, at
  the side a scymitar sable, hilted or, on the head a turban with a
  crescent and feather argent, holding in the dexter hand a crescent of the
  last."</p>

  <p>The crest of Pilkington ["a mower with his scythe in front habited as
  follows: a high-crowned hat with flap, the crown party per pale, flap the
  same, counterchanged; coat buttoned to the middle, with his scythe in
  bend proper, habited through quarterly and counterchanged argent and
  gules"], and the very similar crest of De Trafford, in which the man
  holds a flail, are curious, and are the subjects of appropriate
  legends.</p>

  <p>The crest of Clerk of Pennycuick (a demi-man winding a horn) refers to
  the curious tenure by which the Pennycuick estate is supposed to be held,
  namely, that whenever the sovereign sets foot thereupon, the proprietor
  must blow a horn from a certain rocky point. The motto, "Free for a
  blast," has reference to the same.</p>

  <p>The arms of the College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, I fancy, afford the
  only instance of what is presumably a corpse, the blazon being: "Azure, a
  man (human body) fesswise between a dexter hand having an eye on the palm
  issuing out of a cloud downward and a castle situate on a rock proper,
  within a bordure or charged with several instruments peculiar to the art
  (<i>sic</i>); on a canton of the first a saltire argent surmounted of a
  thistle vert, crowned of the third."</p>

  <p>When we come to parts of the human body instances of heads, arms, and
  legs are legion.</p>

  <p>There are certain well-known heraldic heads, and though many instances
  occur where the blazon is simply a "man's head," it will be most
  frequently found that it is more specifically described.</p>

  <p>Sloane Evans in his "Grammar of Heraldry" specifies eight different
  varieties, namely: 1. The wild man's; 2. The Moor's; 3. The Saracen's; 4.
  The Saxon's; 5. The Englishman's; 6. The old man's; 7. The woman's; 8.
  The child's.</p>

  <p>The wild man's or savage's head is usually represented with a wreath
  of leaves about the temples, but not necessarily so (Fig. 253).</p>

  <p>The head of the Moor, or "blackamoor," as it is more usually
  described, is almost always in profile, and very frequently adorned with
  a twisted wreath (torse) about the temples (Fig. 254).</p>

  <p>The head of the Saracen is also usually found with wreaths about the
  temples (Fig. 255).</p>

  <p>The head of the Saxon is borne by several Welsh families, and is
  supposed to be known by the absence of a beard.</p>

  <p>The Englishman's head, which is borne by the Welsh family of Lloyd of
  Plymog, has no very distinctive features, except that whilst the hair and
  beard of the savage are generally represented brown, they <!-- Page 168
  --><span class="pagenum" title="196.png"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>are black in the case of the Moor and
  Saracen, and fair for the Saxon and Englishman.</p>

  <p>The old man's head, which, like that of the Saxon and Englishman, is
  seldom met with, is bald and grey-haired and bearded.</p>

  <p>But for all practical purposes these varieties may be all disregarded
  except the savage's (Fig. 253), the blackamoor's (Fig. 254), and the
  Saracen's (Fig. 255). Examples of the savage's head will be found in the
  arms of Eddington of Balbartan ["Azure, three savages' heads couped
  argent"], in the arms of Gladstone, and in the canting coat of Rochead of
  Whitsonhill ["Argent, a savage's head erased, distilling drops of blood
  proper, between three combs azure"]. Moir of Otterburn bears the Moors'
  heads ["Argent, three negroes' heads couped proper within a bordure
  counter-indented sable and or"], and Moir of Stonniwood matriculated a
  somewhat similar coat in which the heads are termed Mauritanian ["Argent,
  three Mauritanian negroes' heads couped and distilling guttés-de-sang"].
  Alderson of Homerton, Middlesex, bears Saracens' heads ["Argent, three
  Saracens' heads affronté, couped at the shoulders proper, wreathed about
  the temples of the first and sable"].</p>

  <p>The woman's head (Fig. 256) in heraldry is always represented young
  and beautiful (that is, if the artist is capable of so drawing it), and
  it is almost invariably found with golden hair. The colour, however,
  should be blazoned, the term "crined" being used. Five maidens' heads
  appear upon the arms of the town of Reading, and the crest of Thornhill
  shows the same figure. The arms of the Mercers' Livery Company ["Gules, a
  demi-virgin couped below the shoulders, issuing from clouds all proper,
  vested or, crowned with an Eastern crown of the last, her hair
  dishevelled, and wreathed round the temples with roses of the second, all
  within an orle of clouds proper"] and of the Master of the Revels in
  Scotland ["Argent, a lady rising out of a cloud in the nombril point,
  richly apparelled, on her head a garland of ivy, holding in her right
  hand a poinziard crowned, in her left a vizard all proper, standing <!--
  Page 169 --><span class="pagenum" title="197.png"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span>under a veil or canopy azure, garnished
  or, in base a thistle vert"] are worthy of quotation.</p>

  <p>The boy's head will seldom be found except in Welsh coats, of which
  the arms of Vaughan and Price are examples.</p>

  <p>Another case in which the heads of children appear are the arms of
  Fauntleroy ["Gules, three infants' heads couped at the shoulders proper,
  crined or"], which are a very telling instance of a canting device upon
  the original form of the name, which was "Enfantleroy."</p>

  <p>Children, it may be here noted, are seldom met with in armory, but
  instances will be found in the arms of Davies, of Marsh, co. Salop
  ["Sable, a goat argent, attired or, standing on a child proper swaddled
  gules, and feeding on a tree vert"], of the Foundling Hospital ["Per
  fesse azure and vert, in chief a crescent argent, between two mullets of
  six points or, in base an infant exposed, stretching out its arms for
  help proper"], and in the familiar "bird and bantling" crest of Stanley,
  Earls of Derby. Arms and hands are constantly met with, and have certain
  terms of their own. A hand should be stated to be either dexter (Fig.
  257), or sinister (Fig. 258), and is usually blazoned and always
  understood to be couped at the wrist. If the hand is open and the palm
  visible it is "apaumé" (Figs. 257 and 258), but this being by far the
  most usual position in which the hand is met with, unless represented to
  be holding anything, the term "apaumé" is not often used in blazon, that
  position being presumed unless anything contrary is stated.</p>

  <p>The hand is occasionally represented "clenched," as in the arms and
  crest of Fraser-Mackintosh. When the thumb and first two fingers are
  raised, they are said to be "raised in benediction" (Fig. 259).</p>

  <p>The cubit arm (Fig. 260), should be carefully distinguished from the
  arm couped at the elbow (Fig. 261). The former includes only about
  two-thirds of the entire arm from the elbow. The form "couped at the
  elbow" is not frequently met with.</p>

  <p>When the whole arm from the shoulder is used, it is always bent at
  <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum" title="198.png"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>the elbow, and this is signified by the
  term "embowed," and an arm embowed necessarily includes the whole arm.
  Fig. 262 shows the usual position of an arm embowed, but it is sometimes
  placed embowed to the dexter (Fig. 263), upon the point of the elbow,
  that is, "embowed fesseways" (Fig. 264), and also, but still more
  infrequently, resting on the upper arm (Fig. 265). Either of the latter
  positions must be specified in the blazon. Two arms "counter-embowed"
  occur in many crests (Figs. 266 and 267).</p>

  <p>When the arm is bare it is termed "proper." When clothed it is termed

  crest is then also termed "cuffed." The hand is nearly always bare, but
  if not represented of flesh colour it will be presumed and termed to be
  "gloved" of such and such a tincture. When it is represented in armour it
  is termed "in armour" or "vambraced" (Fig. 269). Even when in armour the
  hand is usually bare, but if in a gauntlet this must be specifically so
  stated (Fig. 270). The armour is always represented as riveted
  <i>plate</i> armour unless it is specifically stated to be <i>chain
  armour</i>, as in the crest of Bathurst, or <i>scale armour</i>. Armour
  is sometimes decorated with gold, when the usual term employed will be
  "garnished or," though occasionally the word "purfled" is used.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XI</h5>

<h5>THE HERALDIC LION</h5>

  <p>Heraldic art without the lion would not amount to very much, for no
  figure plays such an important or such an extensive part in armory as the
  lion, in one or other of its various positions. These present-day
  positions are the results of modern differentiation, arising from the
  necessity of a larger number of varying coats of arms; but there can be
  little doubt that in early times the majority of these positions did not
  exist, having been gradually evolved, and that originally the heraldic
  animal was just "a lion." The shape of the shield was largely a governing
  factor in the manner in which we find it depicted; the old artists, with
  a keener artistic sense than is evidenced in so many later examples of
  heraldic design, endeavoured to fill up as large a proportion of the
  space available as was possible, and consequently when only one lion was
  to be depicted upon the shield they very naturally drew the animal in an
  upright position, this being the one most convenient and adaptable for
  their purpose. Probably their knowledge of natural history was very
  limited, and this upright position would seem to them the most natural,
  and probably was the only one they knew; at any rate, at first it is
  almost the only position to be found. A curious commentary upon this may
  be deduced from the head-covering of Geoffrey of Anjou (Fig. 28), which
  shows a lion. This lion is identically of the form and shape of the lions
  rampant upon the shield, but from the nature of the space it occupies, is
  what would now be termed statant; but there is at the same time no such
  alteration in the relative position of the limbs as would now be
  required. This would seem to indicate very clearly that there was but the
  one stereotyped pattern of a lion, which answered all their purposes, and
  that our fore-runners applied that one pattern to the spaces they desired
  to decorate.</p>

  <p>Early heraldry, however, when the various positions came into
  recognised use, soon sought to impose this definite distinction, that the
  lion could only be depicted erect in the <i>rampant</i> position, and
  that an animal represented to be walking must therefore be a
  <i>leopard</i> from the very position which it occupied. This, however,
  was a distinction known only to the more pedantic heralds, and found
  greatest favour <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum" title="201.png"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>amongst the French; but we find in
  Glover's Roll, which is a copy of a roll originally drawn up about the
  year 1250, that whilst he gives lions to six of the English earls, he
  commences with "le Roy d'Angleterre porte, Gules, trois lupards d'or." On
  the other hand, the monkish chronicler John of Harmoustier in Touraine (a
  contemporary writer) relates that when Henry I. chose Geoffrey, son of
  Foulk, Earl of Anjou, Touraine, and Main, to be his son-in-law, by
  marrying him to his only daughter and heir, Maud the Empress, and made
  him knight; after the bathing and other solemnities (pedes ejus
  solutaribus in superficie Leonculos aureos habentibus muniuntur), boots
  embroidered with golden lions were drawn on his legs, and also that
  (Clypeus Leonculos aureos imaginarios habens collo ejus suspenditur) a
  shield with lions of gold therein was hung about his neck.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, evident that the refinement of distinction between a
  lion and a leopard was not of the beginning; it is a later addition to
  the earlier simple term of lion. This distinction having been invented by
  French heralds, and we taking so much of our heraldry, our language, and
  our customs from France, adopted, and to a certain extent used, this
  description of lions passant as "leopards." There can be no doubt,
  however, that the lions passant guardant upon the English shield have
  always been represented as <i>lions</i>, no matter what they may have
  been called, and the use of the term leopard in heraldry to signify a
  certain position for the lion never received any extensive sanction, and
  has long since become obsolete in British armory. In French blazon,
  however, the old distinction is still observed, and it is curious to
  observe that on the coins of the Channel Islands the shield of arms
  distinctly shows three leopards. The French lion is our lion rampant, the
  French leopard is our lion passant guardant, whilst they term our lion
  passant a <i>léopard-lionné</i>, and our lion rampant guardant is their
  <i>lion-léopardé</i>.</p>

  <p>A lion rampant and any other beast of prey is usually represented in
  heraldry with the tongue and claws of a different colour from the animal.
  If it is not itself gules, its tongue and claws are usually represented
  as of that colour, unless the lion be on a field of gules. They are then
  represented azure, the term being "armed and langued" of such and such a
  colour. It is not necessary to mention that a lion is "armed and langued"
  in the blazon when tongue and claws are emblazoned in gules, but whenever
  any other colour is introduced for the purpose it is better that it
  should be specified. Outside British heraldry a lion is always supposed
  to be rampant unless otherwise specifically described. The earliest
  appearance of the lions in the arms of any member of the Royal Family in
  England would appear to be the seal of King John when he was Prince and
  before he <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum" title="202.png"><a
  name="page174"></a>{174}</span>ascended the throne. This seal shows his
  arms to be two lions passant. The English Royal crest, which originated
  with Richard I., is now always depicted as a lion statant guardant. There
  can be no doubt, however, that this guardant attitude is a subsequent
  derivation from the position of the lions on the shield, when heraldry
  was ceasing to be actual and becoming solely pictorial. We find in the
  case of the crest of Edward the Black Prince, now suspended over his tomb
  in Canterbury Cathedral, that the lion upon the chapeau looks straight
  forward over the front of the helm (see Fig. 271).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:10%;">
      <a href="images/fig272.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig272.png"
      alt="Fig. 272." title="Fig. 272." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 272.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Another ancient rule belonging to the same period as the controversy
  between leopards and lions was that there cannot be more than <i>one
  lion</i> upon a shield, and this was one of the great arguments used to
  determine that the charges on the Royal Arms of England must be leopards
  and not lions. It was admitted as a rule of British armory to a limited
  extent, viz., that when two or more lions rampant appeared upon the same
  shield, unless combatant, they were always formerly described as
  lioncels. Thus the arms of Bohun are: "Azure, a bend argent, cottised
  between six lioncels rampant or." British heraldry has, however, long
  since disregarded any such rule (if any definite rule ever really existed
  upon the point), though curiously enough in the recent grant of arms to
  the town of Warrington the animals are there blazoned six "lioncels."</p>

  <p>The artistic evolution of the lion rampant can be readily traced in
  the examples and explanations which follow, but, as will be understood,
  the employment in the case of some of these models cannot strictly be
  said to be confined within a certain number of years, though the details
  and periods given are roughly accurate, and sufficiently so to typify the
  changes which have occurred.</p>

  <p>Until perhaps the second half of the thirteenth century the body of
  the lion appears straight upright, so that the head, the trunk, and the
  left hind-paw fall into the angle of the shield. The left fore-paw is
  horizontal, the right fore- and the right hind-paw are placed diagonally
  (or obliquely) upwards (Fig. 272). The paws each end in three knobs,
  similar to a clover-leaf, out of which the claws come forth. The fourth
  or inferior toes appeared in heraldry somewhat later. The jaws are closed
  or only very slightly opened, without the tongue being visible. The tail
  is thickened in the middle with a bunch of longer hair and is turned down
  towards the body.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">
      <a href="images/fig271.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig271.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.

      alt="Fig. 273." title="Fig. 273." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 273.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>In the course of the period lasting from the second half of the
  thirteenth to the second half of the fourteenth centuries, the right
  hind-paw sinks lower until it forms a right angle with the left. The
  mouth <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum" title="205.png"><a
  name="page175"></a>{175}</span>grows pointed, and in the second half of
  the period the tongue becomes visible. The tail also shows a knot near
  its root (Fig. 273).</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:12%;">
      <a href="images/fig274.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig274.png"
      alt="Fig. 274." title="Fig. 274." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 274.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>In examples taken from the second half of the fourteenth century and
  the fifteenth century the lion's body is no longer placed like a pillar,
  but lays its head back to the left so that the right fore-paw falls into
  an oblique upward line with the trunk. The toes are lengthened, appearing
  almost as fingers, and spread out from one another; the tail, adorned
  with flame-like bunches of hair, strikes outwards and loses the
  before-mentioned knot, which only remains visible in a forked tail
  (<i>queue-fourché</i>). The jaws grow deep and are widely opened, and the
  breast rises and expands under the lower jaw (Fig. 274).</p>

  <p>Lions of peculiar virility and beauty appear upon a fourteenth-century
  banner which shows the arms of the family of Talbot, Earls of Shrewsbury:
  Gules, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailed or, quartered with the
  arms of <i>Strange</i>: Argent, two lions passant in pale gules, armed
  and langued azure. Fig. 275 gives the lower half of the banner which was
  published in colours in the Catalogue of the Heraldic Exhibition in
  London, 1894.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 276.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 276 is an Italian coat of arms of the fourteenth century, and
  shows a lion of almost exactly the same design, except the paws are <!--
  Page 176 --><span class="pagenum" title="206.png"><a
  name="page176"></a>{176}</span>here rendered somewhat more heraldically.
  The painting (azure, a lion rampant argent) served as an "Ex libris," and
  bears the inscription "Libe accusacionum mey p. he ..." (The remainder
  has been cut away. It is reproduced from Warnecke's "German Bookplates,"
  1890.)</p>

  <p>When we come to modern examples of lions, it is evident that the
  artists of the present day very largely copy lions which are really the
  creations of, or adaptations from, the work of their predecessors. The
  lions of the late Mr. Forbes Nixon, as shown in Fig. 277, which were
  specially drawn by him at my request as typical of his style, are
  respectively as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>A winged lion passant coward. A lion rampant regardant. A lion rampant
  queue-fourché. A lion passant crowned. A lion passant. A lion rampant. A
  lion rampant to the sinister. A lion passant guardant, ducally gorged. A
  lion statant guardant, ducally crowned. A lion rampant. A lion statant
  guardant. A lion sejant guardant erect. Lions drawn by Mr. Scruby will be
  found in Figs. 278 and 279, which are respectively: "Argent, a lion
  rampant sable," "Sable, a lion passant guardant argent," and "Sable, a
  lion rampant argent." These again were specially drawn by Mr. Scruby as
  typical of his style.</p>

  <p>The lions of Mr. Eve would seem to be entirely original. Their
  singularly graceful form and proportions are perhaps best shown by Figs.
  280 and 281, which are taken from his book "Decorative Heraldry."</p>

  <p>The lions of Mr. Graham Johnston can be appreciated from the examples
  in Figs. 284-9.</p>

  <p>Examples of lions drawn by Miss Helard will be found in Figs. 282,
  283.</p>

  <p>The various positions which modern heraldry has evolved for the lions,
  together with the terms of blazon used to describe these positions, are
  as follows, and the differences can best be appreciated from a series
  drawn by the same artist, in this case Mr. Graham Johnston:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lion rampant.</i>&mdash;The animal is here depicted in profile, and
  erect, resting upon its sinister hind-paw (see Fig. 284). <!-- Page 177
  --><span class="pagenum" title="207.png"><a
  name="page177"></a>{177}</span></p>

  <p><i>Lion rampant guardant.</i>&mdash;In this case the head of the lion
  is turned to face the spectator (Fig. 285).</p>

      <a href="images/fig277.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig277.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    277.</span>&mdash;Lions. (Drawn by Mr. J. Forbes Nixon.)</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Lion rampant regardant.</i>&mdash;In this case the head is turned
  completely round, looking backwards (Fig. 286).</p>

  <p><i>Lion rampant, double-queued.</i>&mdash;In this case the lion is
  represented as <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum" title="208.png"><a
  name="page178"></a>{178}</span>having two tails (Fig. 287). These must
  both be apparent from the base of the tail, otherwise confusion will
  arise with the next example.</p>

  <p><i>Lion rampant queue-fourché.</i>&mdash;In this case one tail springs
  from the base, which is divided or "forked" in the centre (Fig. 288).
  There is no doubt that whilst in modern times and with regard to modern
  arms this distinction must be adhered to, anciently queue-fourché and
  double-queued were interchangeable terms.</p>

  <p><i>Lion Rampant Tricorporate.</i>&mdash;In this case three bodies are
  united in one head (Fig. 292). Both this and the preceding variety are
  most unusual, but the tricorporate lion occurs in a coat of arms
  (<i>temp.</i> Car. II.) registered in Ulster's Office: "Or, a
  tricorporate lion rampant, the bodies disposed in the dexter and sinister
  chief points and in base, all meeting in one head guardant in the fess
  point sable."</p>

  <p><i>Lion coward.</i>&mdash;In this case the tail of the lion is
  depressed, passing between its hind legs (Fig. 293). The exactitude of
  this term is to some extent modern. Though a lion cowarded was known in
  ancient days, there can be no doubt that formerly an artist felt himself
  quite at liberty to put the tail between the legs if this seemed
  artistically desirable, without necessarily having interfered with the
  arms by so doing.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Lion couped in all its joints</i> is a charge which seems peculiar
  to the family of Maitland, and it would be interesting to learn to what
  source its origin can be traced. It is represented with each of its four
  paws, its head and its tail severed from the body, and removed slightly
  away therefrom. A Maitland coat of arms exhibiting this peculiarity will
  be found in Fig. 294. <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum" title="211.png"

  <p><i>Lions rampant combatant</i> are so termed when two are depicted in
  one shield facing each other in the attitude of fighting (Fig. 295).</p>

  <p>A very curious and unique instance of a lion rampant occurs in the
  arms of Williams (matriculated in Lyon Register in 1862, as the second
  and third quarterings of the arms of Sir James Williams Drummond of
  Hawthornden, Bt.), the coat in question being: Argent, a lion rampant,
  the body sable, the head, paws, and tuft of the tail of the field.</p>

  <p><i>Lion passant.</i>&mdash;A lion in this position (Fig. 296) is
  represented in the act of walking, the dexter forepaw being raised, but
  all three others being upon the ground.</p>

  <p><i>Lion passant guardant.</i>&mdash;This (Fig. 297) is the same as the
  previous position, except that the head is turned to face the spectator.
  The lions in the quartering for England in the Royal coat of arms are
  "three lions passant guardant in pale."</p>

  <p><i>Lion of England.</i>&mdash;This is "a lion passant guardant or,"
  and the term is only employed for a lion of this description when it
  occurs as or in an honourable augmentation, then being usually
  represented on a field of gules. A lion passant guardant or, is now never
  granted to any applicant except under a specific Royal Warrant to that
  effect. It occurs in many augmentations, <i>e.g.</i> Wolfe, Camperdown,
  and many others; and when three lions passant guardant in pale or upon a
  canton gules are granted, as in the arms of Lane (Plate II.), the
  augmentation is termed a "canton of England."</p>

  <p><i>Lion passant regardant</i> is as the lion passant, but with the
  head turned right round looking behind (Fig. 298). A lion is not often
  met with in this position.</p>

  <p><i>Lions passant dimidiated.</i>&mdash;A curious survival of the
  ancient but now <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum" title="212.png"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>obsolete practice of dimidiation is found
  in the arms of several English seaport towns. Doubtless all can be traced
  to the "so-called" arms of the "Cinque Ports," which show three lions
  passant guardant dimidiated with the hulks of three ships. There can be
  no doubt whatever that this originally came from the dimidiation of two
  separate coats, viz. the Royal Arms of England (the three lions passant
  guardant), and the other "azure, three ships argent," typical of the
  Cinque Ports, referring perhaps to the protection of the coasts for which
  they were liable, or possibly merely to their seaboard position. Whilst
  Sandwich<a name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> uses the two
  separate coats simply dimidiated upon one shield, the arms of Hastings<a
  name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> vary slightly, being:
  "Party per pale gules and azure, a lion passant guardant or, between in
  chief and in base a lion passant guardant of the last dimidiated with the
  hulk of a ship argent." From long usage we have grown accustomed to
  consider these two conjoined and dimidiated figures as one figure (Fig.
  299), and in the recent grant of arms to Ramsgate<a name="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> a figure of this kind was granted as a
  simple charge.</p>

  <p>The arms of Yarmouth<a name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
  afford another instance of a resulting figure of this class, the three
  lions passant guardant of England being here dimidiated with as many
  herrings naiant.</p>

  <p><i>Lion statant.</i>&mdash;The distinction between a lion passant and
  a lion statant is that the lion statant has all four paws resting upon
  the <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum" title="213.png"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span>ground. The two forepaws are usually
  placed together (Fig. 300). Whilst but seldom met with as a charge upon a
  shield, the lion statant is by no means rare as a crest.</p>

  <p><i>Lion statant tail extended.</i>&mdash;This term is a curious and,
  seemingly, a purposeless refinement, resulting from the perpetuation in
  certain cases of one particular method of depicting the
  crest&mdash;originally when a crest a lion was always so drawn&mdash;but
  it cannot be overlooked, because in the crests of both Talbot, Earl of
  Shrewsbury, and Percy, Duke of Northumberland, the crest is now
  stereotyped as a lion in this form (Fig. 301) upon a chapeau.</p>

  Sebastian Schärtlin (Schertel) von Burtenbach ["Gules, a lion sejant
  affronté erect, double-queued, holding in its dexter paw a key argent and
  in its sinister a fleur-de-lis"]. His victorious assault on Rome in 1527,
  and his striking successes against France in 1532, are strikingly
  typified in these arms, which were granted in 1534.</p>

  <p><i>Lion morné.</i>&mdash;This is a lion without teeth and claws, but

  (Fig. 313). The true lion of St. Mark (that is, when used as a badge for
  sacred purposes to typify St. Mark) has a halo. Winged lions are the
  supporters of Lord Braye.</p>

  <p><i>Sea lion</i> (or, to use another name for it, a <i>morse</i>) is
  the head, forepaws, and upper part of a lion conjoined to the tail of a
  fish. The most frequent form in which sea lions appear are as supporters,
  but they are also met with as crests and charges. When placed
  horizontally they are termed naiant. Sea lions, however, will also be
  found "sejant" and "sejant-erect" (Fig. 314). When issuing from waves of
  the sea they are termed "assurgeant."</p>

  <p><i>Lion-dragon.</i>&mdash;One hesitates to believe that this creature
  has any existence outside heraldry books, where it is stated to be of
  similar form and construction to the sea lion, the difference being that
  the lower half is the body and tail of a wyvern. I know of no actual arms

  they also occur in the arms of Radford. This semi-human animal is
  sometimes termed a "lympago" (Fig. 315).</p>

  <p><i>Other terms relating to lions</i> occur in many heraldic
  works&mdash;both old and new&mdash;but their use is very limited, if
  indeed of some, any example at all could be found in British armory. In
  addition to this, whilst the fact may sometimes exist, the <i>term</i>
  has never been adopted or officially recognised. Personally I believe
  most of the terms which follow may for all practical purposes be entirely
  disregarded. Amongst such terms are <i>contourné</i>, applied to a lion
  passant or rampant to the sinister. It would, however, be found blazoned
  in these words and not as contourné. "Dismembered," "Demembré,"
  "Dechaussée," and "Trononnée" are all "heraldry-book" terms specified to
  mean the same as "couped in all its joints," but the uselessness and
  uncertainty concerning these terms is exemplified by the fact that the
  <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum" title="217.png"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>same books state "dismembered" or
  "demembré" to mean (when applied to a lion) that the animal is shown
  without legs or tail. The term "embrued" is sometimes applied to a lion
  to signify that its mouth is bloody and dropping blood; and "vulned"
  signifies wounded, heraldically represented by a blotch of gules, from
  which drops of blood are falling. A lion "disarmed" is without teeth,
  tongue, or claws.</p>

  <p>A term often found in relation to lions rampant, but by no means
  peculiar thereto, is "debruised." This is used when it is partly defaced
  by another charge (usually an ordinary) being placed over it.</p>

  <p>Another of these guide-book terms is "decollated," which is said to be
  employed in the case of a lion which has its head cut off. A lion
  "defamed" or "diffamed" is supposed to be rampant to the sinister but
  looking backwards, the supposition being that the animal is being
  (against his will) chased off the field with infamy. A lion "evire" is
  supposed to be emasculated and without signs of sex. In this respect it
  is interesting to note that in earlier days, before mock modesty and
  prudery had become such prominent features of our national life, the
  genital organ was always represented of a pronounced size in a prominent
  position, and it was as much a matter of course to paint it gules as it
  now is to depict the tongue of that colour. To prevent error I had better
  add that this is not now the usual practice.</p>

  <p>Lions placed back to back are termed "endorsed" or "addorsed," but
  when two lions passant in pale are represented, one passing to the dexter
  and one to the sinister, they are termed "counter-passant." This term is,
  however, also used sometimes when they are merely passant towards each
  other. A more correct description in such cases would be passant
  "respecting" or "regarding" each other.</p>

  <p>The term <i>lionné</i> is one stated to be used with animals other
  than lions when placed in a rampant position. Whilst doubtless of regular
  acceptation in French heraldry as applied to a leopard, it is unknown in
  English, and the term rampant is indifferently applied; <i>e.g.</i> in
  the case of a leopard, wolf, or tiger when in the rampant position.</p>

  <p><i>Lionced</i> is a term seldom met with, but it is said to be applied
  (for example to a cross) when the arms end in lions' heads. I have yet to
  find an authentic example of the use of such a cross.</p>

  <p>When a bend or other ordinary issues from the mouths of lions (or
  other animals), the heads issuing from the edges or angles of the
  escutcheon, the ordinary is said to be "engouled."</p>

  <p>A curious term, of the use of which I know only one example, is
  "fleshed" or "flayed." This, as doubtless will be readily surmised, means
  that the skin is removed, leaving the flesh gules. This was the method by
  which the supporters of Wurtemburg were "differenced" for the Duke of
  Teck, the forepaws being "fleshed." <!-- Page 188 --><span

  <p>Woodward gives the following very curious instances of the lion in
  heraldry:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Only a single example of the use of the lioness as a heraldic charge
  is known to me. The family of <span class="sc">Coing</span>, in Lorraine,
  bears: d'Azure, à une lionne arrêtée d'or.</p>

  <p>"The following fourteenth-century examples of the use of the lion as a
  heraldic charge are taken from the oft-quoted <i>Wappenrolle von
  Zurich</i>, and should be of interest to the student of early
  armory:&mdash;</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>"51: <span class="sc">End</span>: Azure, a lion rampant-guardant
  argent, its feet or.</p>

  <p>"305. <span class="sc">Wildenvels</span>: Per pale argent and sable,
  in the first a demi-lion statant-guardant issuant from the dividing
  line.</p>

  <p>"408. <span class="sc">Tannenvels</span>: Azure, a lion rampant or,
  queué argent.</p>

  <p>"489. <span class="sc">Rinach</span>: Or, a lion rampant gules, headed
  azure.</p>

  <p>"A curious use of the lion as a charge occurs in several ancient coats
  of the Low Countries, <i>e.g.</i> in that of <span
  class="sc">Trasegnies</span>, whose arms are: Bandé d'or et d'azur, à
  l'ombre du lion brochant sur le tout, à la bordure engrêlée d'or. Here
  the ombre du lion is properly represented by a darker shade of the
  tincture (either of or or of azure), but often the artist contents
  himself with simply drawing the outline of the animal in a neutral
  tint.</p>

  <p>"Among other curiosities of the use of the lion are the following
  foreign coats:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Boissiau</span>, in France, bears: De gueules, semé
  de lions d'argent.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Minutoli</span>, of Naples: Gules, a lion rampant
  vair, the head and feet or.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Loen</span>, of Holland: Azure, a decapitated lion
  rampant argent, three jets of blood spurting from the neck proper.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Papacoda</span>, of Naples: Sable, a lion rampant
  or, its tail turned over its head and held by its teeth.</p>

  <p>"The Counts <span class="sc">Reinach</span>, of Franconia: Or, a lion
  rampant gules, hooded and masked azure (see above)."</p>

  <p>To these instances the arms of Westbury may well be added, these
  being: Quarterly, or and azure, a cross patonce, on a bordure twenty
  lions rampant all counter-changed. No doubt the origin of such a curious
  bordure is to be found in the "bordure of England," which, either as a
  mark of cadency or as an indication of affinity or augmentation, can be
  found in some number of instances. Probably one will suffice as an
  example. This is forthcoming in Fig. 61, which shows the arms of John de
  Bretagne, Earl of Richmond. Of a similar nature is the bordure of Spain
  (indicative of his maternal descent) borne by Richard of Conisburgh, Earl
  of Cambridge, who bore: Quarterly France and England, a label of three
  points argent, each charged with <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum" title="221.png"
  ><a name="page189"></a>{189}</span>as many torteaux, on a bordure of the
  same twelve lions rampant purpure (Fig. 316).</p>

  <p>Before leaving the lion, the hint may perhaps be usefully conveyed
  that the temptation to over-elaborate the lion when depicting it
  heraldically should be carefully avoided. The only result is
  confusion&mdash;the very contrary of the essence of heraldic
  emblazonment, which was, is, and should be, the method of clear
  advertisement of identity. Examples of over-elaboration can, however, be
  found in the past, as will be seen from Fig. 317. This example belongs to
  the latter half of the fifteenth century, and represents the arms of
  Bohemia. It is taken from a shield on the "Pulver Turme" at Prague.</p>

  <p>Parts of lions are very frequently to be met with, particularly as
  crests. In fact the most common crest in existence is the <i>demi-lion
  rampant</i> (Fig. 318). This is the upper half of a lion rampant. It is
  comparatively seldom found other than rampant and couped, so that the
  term "a demi-lion," unless otherwise qualified, may always be assumed to
  be a demi-lion rampant couped. As charges upon the shield three will be
  found in the arms of Bennet, Earl of Tankerville: "Gules, a bezant
  between three demi-lions rampant argent."</p>

  <p>The demi-lion may be both guardant and regardant.</p>

  <p><i>Demi-lions rampant and erased</i> are more common as charges than
  as crests. They are to be found in several Harrison coats of arms.</p>

  <p><i>Demi-lions passant</i> (Fig. 319) are rather unusual, but in
  addition to the seeming cases in which they occur by dimidiation they are
  sometimes found, as in the case of the arms of Newman. <!-- Page 190
  --><span class="pagenum" title="222.png"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span></p>

  <p><i>Demi-lion affronté.</i>&mdash;The only case which has come under
  notice would appear to be the crest of Campbell of Aberuchill.</p>

  <p><i>Demi-lion issuant.</i>&mdash;This term is applied to a demi-lion
  when it issues from an ordinary, <i>e.g.</i> from the base line of the
  chief, as in the arms of Dormer, Markham, and Abney; or from behind a
  fesse, as in the arms of Chalmers.</p>

  <p><i>Demi-lion naissant</i> issues from the centre of an ordinary, and
  not from behind it.</p>

  <p><i>Lions' heads</i>, both couped (Fig. 320) and erased, are very
  frequently met with both as charges on the shield and as crests.</p>

  <p><i>Lion's gamb.</i>&mdash;Many writers make a distinction between the
  <i>gamb</i> (which is stated to be the lower part only, couped or erased
  half-way up the leg) and the <i>paw</i>, but this distinction cannot be
  said to be always rigidly observed. In fact some authorities quote the
  exact reverse as the definition of the terms. As charges the gamb or paw
  will be found to occur in the arms of Lord Lilford ["Or, a lion's gamb
  erased in bend dexter between two crosslets fitchée in bend sinister
  gules"], and in the arms of Newdigate. This last is a curious example,
  inasmuch as, without being so specified in the blazon, the gambs are
  represented in the position occupied by the sinister foreleg of a lion
  passant.</p>

  <p>The crest upon the Garter Plate of Edward Cherleton, Lord Cherleton of
  Powis, must surely be unique. It consists of two lions' paws embowed, the
  outer edge of each being adorned with fleurs-de-lis issuant
  therefrom.</p>

  <p><i>A lion's tail</i> will sometimes be found as a crest, and it also
  occurs as a charge in the arms of Corke, viz.: "Sable, three lions' tails
  erect and erased argent."</p>

  <p><i>A lion's face</i> (Fig. 321) should be carefully distinguished from
  a lion's head. In the latter case the neck, either couped or erased, must
  be shown; but a lion's face is affronté and cut off closely behind the
  ears. The distinction between the head and the face can be more
  appropriately considered in the case of the leopard. <!-- Page 191

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XII</h5>

<h5>BEASTS</h5>

  <p>Next after the lion should be considered the tiger, but it must be
  distinctly borne in mind that heraldry knows two kinds of
  tigers&mdash;the heraldic tiger (Figs. 322 and 323) and the Bengal tiger
  (Figs. 324 and 325). Doubtless the heraldic tiger, which was the only one
  found in British armory until a comparatively recent date, is the attempt
  of artists to depict their idea of a tiger. The animal was unknown to
  them, except by repute, and consequently the creature they depicted bears
  little relation to the animal of real life; but there can be no doubt
  that their intention was to depict an animal which they knew to exist.
  The heraldic tiger had a body much like the natural tiger, it had a
  lion's tufted tail and mane, and the curious head which it is so
  difficult to describe, but which appears to be more like the wolf than
  any other animal we know. This, however, will be again dealt with in the
  chapter on fictitious animals, and is here only introduced to demonstrate
  the difference which heraldry makes between the heraldic tiger and the
  real animal. A curious conceit is that the heraldic tiger will anciently
  be often found spelt "tyger," but this peculiar spelling does not seem
  ever to have been applied to the tiger of nature.</p>

  <p>When it became desirable to introduce the real tiger into British
  armory as typical of India and our Eastern Empire, something of course
  was necessary to distinguish it from the tyger which had previously
  usurped the name in armory, and for this reason the natural tiger is
  always heraldically known as the Bengal tiger. This armorial variety
  appears towards the end of the eighteenth century in this country, though
  in foreign heraldry it appears to have been recognised somewhat earlier.
  There are, however, but few cases in which the Bengal tiger has appeared
  in armory, and in the majority of these cases as a supporter, as in the
  supporters of Outram, which are two tigers rampant guardant gorged with
  wreaths of laurel and crowned with Eastern crowns all proper. Another
  instance of the tiger as a supporter will be found in the arms of Bombay.
  An instance in which it appears as a charge upon a shield will be found
  in the arms granted to the University of Madras.</p>

  <p>Another coat is that granted in 1874 to Augustus Beaty Bradbury of
  Edinburgh, which was: "Argent, on a mount in base vert, a Bengal tiger
  passant proper, on a chief of the second two other tigers dormant also
  proper." A <i>tigress</i> is said to be occasionally met with, and when
  so, is sometimes represented with a mirror, in relation to the legend
  that ascribes to her such personal vanity that her young ones might be
  taken from under her charge if she had the counter attraction of a
  hand-glass! At least so say the heraldry books, but I have not yet come
  across such a case.</p>

  <p>The leopard (Figs. 326, 327, and 328) has to a certain extent been
  referred to already. Doubtless it is the peculiar cat-like and stealthy
  walk which is so characteristic of the leopard which led to any animal in
  that position being considered a leopard; but the leopard in its natural
  state was of course known to Europeans in the early days of heraldry, and
  appears amongst the lists of heraldic animals apart from its existence as
  "a lion passant." The animal, <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum" title="225.png"
  ><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>however, except as a supporter or
  crest, is by no means common in English heraldry. It will be found,

  <p>A very similar animal is the ounce, which for heraldic purposes is in
  no way altered from the leopard. Parts of the latter will be found in use
  as in the case of the lion. As a crest the demi-leopard, the leopard's
  head (Fig. 329), and the leopard's head affronté (Fig. 330) are often to
  be met with. In both cases it should be noticed that <i>the neck is
  visible</i>, and this should be borne in mind, because this constitutes
  the difference between the leopard's head and the leopard's face (Fig.
  331). The leopard's face is by far the most usual form in which the
  leopard will be found in armory, and can be traced back to quite an early
  period in heraldry. The leopard's face shows no neck at all, the head
  being removed close behind the ears. It is then represented affronté. For
  some unfathomable reason these charges when they occur in the arms of
  Shrewsbury are usually referred to locally as "loggerheads." They were
  perpetuated in the arms of the county in its recent grant. A curious
  development or use of the leopard's face occurs when it is jessant-de-lis
  (Fig. 332). This will be found referred to at greater length under the
  heading of the Fleur-de-lis.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <i>panther</i> is an animal which in its relation to heraldry it
  is difficult to know whether to place amongst the mythical or actual
  animals. No instance occurs to me in which the panther figures as a
  charge in British heraldry, and the panther as a supporter, in the few
  cases in which it is met with, is certainly not the actual animal,
  inasmuch as it is invariably found flammant, <i>i.e.</i> with flames
  issuing from the mouth and ears. In this character it will be found as a
  supporter of the Duke of Beaufort, and derived therefrom as a supporter
  of Lord Raglan. Foreign heraldry carries the panther to a most curious
  result. It is frequently represented with the tail of a lion, horns, and
  for its fore-legs the claws of an eagle. Even in England it is usually
  represented vomiting flames, but the usual method of depicting it on the
  Continent is greatly at variance with our own. Fig. 333 represents the
  same arms of Styria&mdash;Vert, a panther argent, armed close, vomiting
  flames of fire&mdash;from the title-page of the <i>Land-bond</i> of
  Styria in the year 1523, drawn by Hans Burgkmair. In <i>Physiologus</i>,
  a Greek writing <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum" title="227.png"><a
  name="page195"></a>{195}</span>of early Christian times of about the date
  140, which in the course of time has been translated into every tongue,
  mention is made of the panther, to which is there ascribed the gaily
  spotted coat and the pleasant, sweet-smelling breath which induces all
  other animals to approach it; the dragon alone retreats into its hole
  from the smell, and consequently the panther appears to have sometimes
  been used as a symbol of Christ. The earliest armorial representations of
  this animal show the form not greatly dissimilar to nature; but very soon
  the similarity disappears in Continental representations, and the fancy
  of the artist transferred the animal into the fabulous creature which is
  now represented. The sweet-smelling breath, <i>suozzon-stanch</i> as it
  is called in the early German translation of the <i>Physiologus</i>, was
  expressed by the flames issuing from the mouth, but later in the
  sixteenth century flames issued from every opening in the head. The head
  was in old times similar to that of a horse, occasionally horned (as in
  the seal of Count Heinrich von Lechsgemünd, 1197); the fore-feet were
  well developed. In the second half of the fourteenth century the
  fore-feet assume the character of eagles' claws, and the horns of the
  animal were a settled matter. In the neighbourhood of Lake Constance we
  find the panther with divided hoofs on his hind-feet; perhaps with a
  reference to the panther's "cleanness." According to the Mosaic law, of
  course, a four-footed animal, to be considered clean, must not have paws,
  and a ruminant must not have an undivided hoof. Italian heraldry is
  likewise acquainted with the panther, but under another name (<i>La
  Dolce</i>, the sweet one) and another form. The dolce has a head like a
  hare, and is unhorned. (See A. Anthony v. Siegenfeld, "The Territorial
  Arms of Styria," Graz, 1898.)</p>

  <p>The panther is given by Segar, Garter King of Arms 1603-1663, as one
  of the badges of King Henry VI., where it is silver, spotted of various
  colours, and with flames issuing from its mouth and ears. No doubt this
  Royal badge is the origin of the supporter of the Duke of Beaufort.</p>

  <p>English armory knows an animal which it terms the male griffin, which
  has no wings, but which has gold rays issuing from its body in all
  directions. Ströhl terms the badge of the Earls of Ormonde, which from
  his description are plainly male griffins, <i>keythongs</i>, which he
  classes with the panther; and probably he is correct in looking upon our
  male griffin as merely one form of the heraldic panther.</p>

  <p>The <i>cat</i>, under the name of the cat, the wild cat, the
  cat-a-mountain, or the cat-a-mount (Figs. 334, 335, and 336), is by no
  means infrequent in British armory, though it will usually be found in
  Scottish or Irish examples. The arms of Keates and Scott-Gatty in which
  it figures are English examples, however. <!-- Page 196 --><span

  <p>The wolf (Figs. 337-341) is a very frequent charge in English armory.
  Apart from its use as a supporter, in which position it is found in
  conjunction with the shields of Lord Welby, Lord Rendell, and Viscount
  Wolseley, it will be found in the arms of Lovett and in by far the larger
  proportion of the coats for the name of Wilson and in the arms of
  Low.</p>

  <p>The wolf, however, in earlier representations has a less distinctly
  wolf-like character, it being sometimes difficult to distinguish the wolf
  from some other heraldic animals. This is one of these cases in which,
  owing to insufficient knowledge and crude draughtsmanship, ancient
  heraldry is not to be preferred to more realistic treatment. The
  demi-wolf is a very frequent crest, occurring not only in the arms and
  crests of members of the Wilson and many other families, but also as the
  crest of Wolfe. The latter crest is worthy of remark, inasmuch as the
  Royal crown which is held within its paws typifies the assistance given
  to King Charles II., after the battle of Worcester, by Mr. Francis Wolfe
  of Madeley, to whom the crest was granted. King Charles, it may be noted,
  also gave to Mr. Wolfe a silver tankard, upon the lid of which was a
  representation of this crest. Wolves' heads are particularly common,
  especially in Scottish heraldry. An example of them will be found in the
  arms of <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum" title="229.png"><a
  name="page197"></a>{197}</span>"Struan" Robertson, and in the coats used
  by all other members of the Robertson Clan having or claiming descent
  from, or relationship with, the house of Struan. The wolf's head also
  appears in the arms of Skeen. Woodward states that the wolf is the most
  common of all heraldic animals in Spanish heraldry, where it is
  frequently represented as <i>ravissant, i.e.</i> carrying the body of a
  lamb in its mouth or across its back.</p>

  <p>Much akin to the wolf is the <i>Lynx</i>; in fact the heraldic
  representation of the two animals is not greatly different. The lynx does
  not often occur in heraldry except as a supporter, but it will be found
  as the crest of the family of Lynch. The lynx is nearly always depicted
  and blazoned "coward," <i>i.e.</i> with its tail between its legs (Fig.
  342). Another instance of this particular animal is found in the crest of
  Comber.</p>

  <p>A <i>Fox</i> (Figs. 343 and 344) which from the similarity of its
  representation is often confused with a wolf, is said by Woodward to be
  very seldom met with in British heraldry. This is hardly a correct
  statement, inasmuch as countless instances can be produced in which a fox
  figures as a charge, a crest, or a supporter. The fox is found on the
  arms and as the crest, and two are the supporters of Lord Ilchester, and
  instances of its appearance will be found amongst others in the arms <!--
  Page 198 --><span class="pagenum" title="230.png"><a
  name="page198"></a>{198}</span>or crests, for example, of Fox, Colfox,
  and Ashworth. Probably the most curious example of the heraldic fox will
  be found in the arms of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, who for the arms of
  Williams quarters: "Argent, two foxes counter-salient gules, the dexter
  surmounted of the sinister." The face of a fox is termed its mask (Fig.
  345).</p>

  <p><i>The Bear</i> (Figs. 346-349) is frequently found figuring largely
  in coats of arms for the names of Barnard, Baring, Barnes, and Bearsley,
  and for other names which can be considered to bear canting relation to
  the charge. In fact the arms, crest, and motto of Barnard together form
  such an excellent example of the little jokes which characterise heraldry
  that I quote the blazon in full. The coat is "argent, a bear rampant
  sable," the crest is "a demi-bear sable," and the motto "Bear and
  forbear."</p>

  <p>The bear is generally muzzled, but this must not be presumed unless
  mentioned in the blazon. Bears' paws are often found both in crests and
  as charges upon shields, but as they differ little if anything in
  appearance from the lion's gamb, they need not be further particularised.
  To the bear's head, however, considerable attention should be paid,
  inasmuch as the manner of depicting it in England and Scotland differs.
  The bear's head, according to English ideas of heraldry, would be
  depicted down to the shoulders, and would show the neck couped or erased
  (Fig. 350). In Scottish heraldry, bears' heads are almost invariably
  found couped or erased close behind the ears without any of the neck
  being visible (Figs. 351 and 352); they are not, however, represented as
  caboshed or affronté.</p>

  <p><i>The Boar</i> is an animal which, with its parts, will constantly be
  met with in British armory (Figs. 353-355). Theoretically there is a
  difference between the boar, which is the male of the domestic animal,
  and the wild boar, which is the untamed creature of the woods. Whilst the
  latter is usually blazoned as a wild boar or sanglier, the latter is just
  a boar; but for all practical purposes no difference whatever is made in
  heraldic representations of these varieties, though it may be noted that
  the crest of Swinton is often described as a sanglier, as invariably is
  also the crest of Douglas, Earl of Morton ["A sanglier sticking between
  the cleft of an oak-tree fructed, with a lock holding the clefts together
  all proper"]. The boar, like the lion, is usually described as armed and
  langued, but this is not necessary when the tusks are represented in
  their own colour and when the tongue is gules. It will, however, be very
  frequently found that the tusks are or. The "armed," however, does not
  include the hoofs, and if these are to <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="232.png"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>be of
  any colour different from that of the animal, it must be blazoned
  "unguled" of such and such a tincture. Precisely the same distinction
  occurs in the heads of boars (Figs. 356-358) that was referred to in
  bears. The real difference is this, that whilst the English boar's head
  has the neck attached to the head and is couped or erased at the
  shoulders, the Scottish boar's head is separated close behind the ears.
  No one ever troubled to draw any distinction between the two for the
  purposes of blazon, because the English boars' heads were more usually
  drawn with the neck, and the boars' heads in Scotland were drawn couped
  or erased close. But the boars head in Welsh heraldry followed the
  Scottish and not the English type. Matters armorial, however, are now
  cosmopolitan, and one can no longer ascertain that the crest of Campbell
  must be Scottish, or that the crest of any other family must be English;
  and consequently, though the terms will not be found employed officially,
  it is just as well to distinguish them, because armory can provide means
  of such distinction&mdash;the true description of an English boar's head
  being couped or erased "at the neck," the Scottish term being a boar's
  head couped or erased "close."</p>

  <p>Occasionally a boar's head will be stated to be borne erect; this is
  then shown with the mouth pointing upwards. A curious example of this is
  found in the crest of Tyrrell: "A boar's head erect argent, in the mouth
  a peacock's tail proper."</p>

  <p>Woodward mentions three very strange coats of arms in which the
  charge, whilst not being a boar, bears very close connection with it. He
  states that among the curiosities of heraldry we may place the canting
  arms of Ham, of Holland: "Gules, five hams proper, 2, 1, 2." The
  Verhammes also bear: "Or, three hams sable." These commonplace charges
  assume almost a poetical savour when placed beside the matter-of-fact
  coat of the family of Bacquere: "d'Azur, à un ecusson d'or en abîme,
  accompagné de trois groins de porc d'argent," and that of the Wursters of
  Switzerland: "Or, two sausages gules on a gridiron sable, the handle in
  chief."</p>

<h5>HORSES</h5>

  <p>It is not a matter of surprise that the horse is frequently met with
  in armory. It will be found, as in the arms of Jedburgh, carrying a
  mounted warrior (Fig. 359), and the same combination appears as the crest
  of the Duke of Fife. <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum" title="233.png"
  ><a name="page201"></a>{201}</span></p>

  <p>The horse will be found rampant (or forcene, or salient) (Fig. 360),
  and will be found courant (Fig. 361), passant (Fig. 362), and
  trotting.</p>

  <p>When it is "comparisoned" or "furnished" it is shown with saddle and
  bridle and all appurtenances; but if the saddle is not present it would
  only be blazoned "bridled."</p>

  <p>"Gules, a horse argent," really the arms of Westphalia, is popularly
  known in this country as the coat of Hanover, inasmuch as it was the most
  prominent charge upon the inescutcheon or quartering of Hanover formerly
  borne with the Royal Arms. Every one in this country is familiar with the
  expression, "the white horse of Hanover."</p>

  <p>Horses will also be found in many cases as supporters, and these will
  be referred to in the chapter upon that subject, but reference should be
  particularly made here to the crest of the family of Lane, of King's
  Bromley, which is a strawberry roan horse, couped at the flanks, bridled,
  saddled, and holding in its feet the Imperial crown proper. This
  commemorates the heroic action of Mistress Jane Lane, afterwards Lady
  Fisher, and the sister of Sir Thomas Lane, of King's Bromley, who, after
  the battle of Worcester and when King Charles was in hiding, rode from
  Staffordshire to the south coast upon a strawberry roan horse, with King
  Charles as her serving-man. For this the Lane family were first of all
  granted the canton of England as an augmentation to their arms, and
  shortly afterwards this crest of the demi-horse (Plate II.).</p>

  <p>The arms of Trevelyan afford an interesting example of a horse, being:
  "Gules, issuant out of water in base proper, a demi-horse argent, hoofed

  rate heraldry knows of none.</p>

  <p>The crest of the family of Duncombe is curious, and is as follows:
  "Out of a ducal coronet or, a horse's hind-leg sable, the shoe
  argent."</p>

  <p>Though they can hardly be termed animate charges, perhaps one may be
  justified in here mentioning the horse-shoe (Fig. 363), which is far from
  being an uncommon charge. It will be found in various arms for the name
  of Ferrar, Ferrers, Farrer, and Marshall; and, in the arms of one
  Scottish family of Smith, three horse-shoes interlaced together form an
  unusual and rather a curious charge.</p>

  <p>Other instances in which it occurs will be found in the arms of
  Burlton, and in the arms used by the town of Oakham. In the latter case
  it doubtless has reference to the toll of a horse-shoe, which the town
  collects from every peer or member of the Royal Family who passes through
  its limits. The collection of these, which are usually of silver, and are
  carefully preserved, is one of the features of the town.</p>

  <p>The sea-horse, the unicorn, and the pegasus may perhaps be more
  properly considered as mythical animals, and the unicorn will, of course,
  be treated under that heading; but the sea-horse and the pegasus are so
  closely allied in form to the natural animal that perhaps it will be
  simpler to treat of them in this chapter. The sea-horse (Fig. 364) is
  composed of the head and neck of a horse and the tail of a fish, but in
  place of the fore-feet, webbed paws are usually substituted. Two
  sea-horses respecting each other will be found in the coat of arms of
  Pirrie, and sea-horses naiant will be found in the arms of
  M&lsquo;Cammond. It is a matter largely left to the discretion of the
  artist, but the sea-horse will be found as often as not depicted with a
  fin at the back of its neck in place of a mane. A sea-horse as a crest
  will be found in the case of Belfast and in the crests of Clippingdale
  and Jenkinson. The sea-horse is sometimes represented winged, but I know
  of no officially sanctioned example. When represented rising from the sea
  the animal is said to be "assurgeant." <!-- Page 203 --><span

  <p>The pegasus (Figs. 365 and 366), though often met with as a crest or
  found in use as a supporter, is very unusual as a charge upon an
  escutcheon. It will be found, however, in the arms of the Society of the
  Inner Temple and in the arms of Richardson, which afford an example of a
  pegasus rampant and also an example in the crest of a pegasus sejant,
  which at present is the only one which exists in British heraldry.</p>

  <p>Fig. 367 gives a solitary instance of a mare. The arms, which are from
  Grünenberg's <i>Wappenbuch</i> (1483), are attributed to "Herr von
  Frouberg from the Forest in Bavaria," and are: Gules, a mare rampant
  argent, bridled sable.</p>

<h5>DOGS</h5>

  <p>Dogs will be found of various kinds in many English and Scottish coats
  of arms, though more frequently in the former than in the latter. The
  original English dog, the hound of early days, is, of course, the talbot
  (Figs. 368, 369, 370, and 371). Under the heading of <!-- Page 204
  --><span class="pagenum" title="236.png"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>supporters certain instances will be
  quoted in which dogs of various kinds and breeds figure in heraldry, but
  the talbot as a charge will be found in the arms of the old Staffordshire
  family, Wolseley of Wolseley, a cadet of which house is the present
  Field-Marshal Viscount Wolseley. The Wolseley arms are: "Argent, a talbot
  passant gules." Other instances of the talbot will be found in the arms
  or crests of the families of Grosvenor, Talbot, and Gooch. The arms
  "Azure, three talbots statant or," were granted by Cooke to Edward Peke
  of Heldchurchgate, Kent. A sleuth-hound treading gingerly upon the points
  of a coronet ["On a ducal coronet, a sleuth-hound proper, collared and
  leashed gules"] was the crest of the Earl of Perth and Melfort, and one
  wonders whether the motto, "Gang warily," may not really have as much
  relation to the perambulations of the crest as to the dangerous foothold
  amongst the galtraps which is provided for the supporters.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    373.</span>&mdash;Greyhound courant.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Greyhounds (Figs. 372 and 373) are, of course, very frequently met
  with, and amongst the instances which can be mentioned are the arms of
  Clayhills, Hughes-Hunter of Plas Coch, and Hunter of Hunterston. A
  curious coat of arms will be found under the name of Udney of that Ilk,
  registered in the Lyon Office, namely: "Gules, two greyhounds
  counter-salient argent, collared of the field, in the inner point a
  stag's head couped and attired with ten tynes, all between the three
  fleurs-de-lis, two in chief and one in base, or." Another very curious
  coat of arms is registered as the design of the reverse of the seal of
  the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, and is: "Or, a greyhound bitch sable,
  chained to an oak-tree within a loch proper." This curious coat of arms,
  however, being the reverse of the seal, is seldom if ever made use
  of.</p>

  <p>Two bloodhounds are the supporters to the arms of Campbell of
  Aberuchill.</p>

  <p>The dog may be salient, that is, springing, its hind-feet on the
  ground; passant, when it is sometimes known as trippant, otherwise
  walking; and courant when it is at full speed. It will be found
  occasionally couchant or lying down, but if depicted chasing another
  animal (as in the arms of Echlin) it is described as "in full chase," or
  "in full course."</p>

  <p>A mastiff will be found in the crest of Crawshay, and there is a <!--
  Page 205 --><span class="pagenum" title="237.png"><a
  name="page205"></a>{205}</span>well-known crest of a family named
  Phillips which is "a dog sejant regardant surmounted by a bezant charged
  with a representation of a dog saving a man from drowning." Whether this
  crest has any official authority or not I do not know, but I should
  imagine it is highly doubtful.</p>

  <p>Foxhounds appear as the supporters of Lord Hindlip; and when depicted
  with its nose to the ground a dog is termed "a hound on scent."</p>

  <p>A winged greyhound is stated to be the crest of a family of Benwell. A
  greyhound "courant" will be found in the crests of Daly and Watney; and a
  curious crest is that of Biscoe, which is a greyhound seizing a hare. The
  crest of Anderson, until recently borne by the Earl of Yarborough, is a
  water spaniel.</p>

  <p>The sea-dog (Fig. 374) is a most curious animal. It is represented
  much as the talbot, but with scales, webbed feet, and a broad scaly tail
  like a beaver. In my mind there is very little doubt that the sea-dog is
  really the early heraldic attempt to represent a beaver, and I am
  confirmed in that opinion by the arms of the city of Oxford. There has
  been considerable uncertainty as to what the sinister supporter was
  intended to represent. A reference to the original record shows that a
  beaver is the real supporter, but the representation of the animal, which
  in form has varied little, is very similar to that of a sea-dog. The only
  instances I am aware of in British heraldry in which it occurs under the
  name of a sea-dog are the supporters of the Barony of Stourton and the
  crest of Dodge<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> (Plate
  VI.).</p>

<h5>BULLS</h5>

  <p>The bull (Figs. 375 and 376), and also the calf, and very occasionally
  the cow and the buffalo, have their allotted place in heraldry. <!-- Page
  206 --><span class="pagenum" title="238.png"><a
  name="page206"></a>{206}</span>They are amongst the few animals which can
  never be represented proper, inasmuch as in its natural state the bull is
  of very various colours. And yet there is an exception to even this
  apparently obvious fact, for the bulls connected with or used either as
  crests, badges, or supporters by the various branches of the Nevill
  family are all pied bulls ["Arms of the Marquis of Abergavenny: Gules, on
  a saltire argent, a rose of the field, barbed and seeded proper. Crest: a
  bull statant argent, pied sable, collared and chain reflexed over the
  back or. Supporters; two bulls argent, pied sable, armed, unguled,
  collared and chained, and at the end of the chain two staples or. Badges:
  on the dexter a rose gules, seeded or, barbed vert; on the sinister a
  portcullis or. Motto: 'Ne vile velis.'"] The bull in the arms of the town
  of Abergavenny, which are obviously based upon the arms and crest of the
  Marquess of Abergavenny, is the same.</p>

  <p>Examples of the bull will be found in the arms of Verelst, Blyth, and
  Ffinden. A bull salient occurs in the arms of De Hasting ["Per pale vert
  and or, a bull salient counterchanged"]. The arms of the Earl of
  Shaftesbury show three bulls, which happen to be the quartering for
  Ashley. This coat of arms affords an instance, and a striking one, of the
  manner in which arms have been improperly assumed in England. The surname
  of the Earl of Shaftesbury is Ashley-Cooper. It may be mentioned here in
  passing, through the subject is properly dealt with elsewhere in the
  volume, that in an English sub-quarterly coat for a double name the arms
  for the last and most important name are the first and fourth
  quarterings. But Lord Shaftesbury himself is the only person who bears
  the name of Cooper, all other members of the family except his lordship
  being known by the name of Ashley only. Possibly this may be the reason
  which accounts for the fact that by a rare exception Lord Shaftesbury
  bears the arms of Ashley in the first and fourth quarters, and Cooper in
  the second and third. But by a very general mistake these arms of Ashley
  ["Argent, three bulls passant sable, armed and unguled or"] were until
  recently almost invariably described as the arms of Cooper. The result
  has been that during the last century they were "jumped" right and left
  by people of the name of Cooper, entirely in ignorance of the fact that
  the arms of Cooper (if it were, as one can only presume, the popular
  desire to indicate a false relationship to his lordship) are: "Gules, a
  bend engrailed between six lions rampant or." The ludicrous result has
  been that to those who know, the arms have stood self-condemned, and in
  the course of time, as it has become necessary for these Messrs. Cooper
  to legalise these usurped insignia, the new grants, differentiated
  versions of arms previously in use, have nearly all been founded upon
  this Ashley coat. At any rate there must be a score or more Cooper <!--
  Page 207 --><span class="pagenum" title="239.png"><a
  name="page207"></a>{207}</span>grants with bulls as the principal
  charges, and innumerable people of the name of Cooper are still using
  without authority the old Ashley coat pure and simple.</p>

  <p>The bull as a crest is not uncommon, belonging amongst other families
  to Ridley, Sykes, and De Hoghton; and the demi-bull, and more frequently
  the bull's head, are often met with. A bull's leg is the crest of De la
  Vache, and as such appears upon two of the early Garter plates. Winged
  bulls are the supporters of the Butchers' Livery Company. A bull's scalp
  occurs upon a canton over the arms of Cheney, a coat quartered by
  Johnston and Cure.</p>

  <p>The ox seldom occurs, except that, in order sometimes to preserve a
  pun, a bovine animal is sometimes so blazoned, as in the case of the arms
  of the City of Oxford. Cows also are equally rare, but occur in the arms
  of Cowell ["Ermine, a cow statant gules, within a bordure sable,
  bezantée"] and in the modern grants to the towns of Rawtenstall and
  Cowbridge. Cows' heads appear on the arms of Veitch ["Argent, three cows'
  heads erased sable"], and these were transferred to the cadency bordure
  of the Haig arms when these were rematriculated for Mr. H. Veitch
  Haig.</p>

  <p>Calves are of much more frequent occurrence than cows, appearing in
  many coats of arms in which they are a pun upon the name. They will be
  found in the arms of Vaile and Metcalfe (Fig. 378). Special attention may
  well be drawn to the last-mentioned illustration, inasmuch as it is by
  Mr. J. H. Metcalfe, whose heraldic work has obtained a well-deserved
  reputation. A bull or cow is termed "armed" if the horns are of a
  different tincture from the head. The term "unguled" applies to the
  hoofs, and "ringed" is used when, as is sometimes the case, a ring passes
  through the nostrils. A bull's head is sometimes found caboshed (Fig.
  377), as in the crest of Macleod, or as in the arms of Walrond. The
  position of the tail is one of those matters which are left to the
  artist, and unless the blazon contains any statement to the contrary, it
  may be placed in any convenient position.</p>

<h5>STAGS</h5>

  <p>The stag, using the term in its generic sense, under the various names
  of stag, deer, buck, roebuck, hart, doe, hind, reindeer, springbok, and
  other varieties, is constantly met with in British armory, as well as in
  that of other countries.</p>

  <p>In the specialised varieties, such as the springbok and the reindeer,
  naturally an attempt is made to follow the natural animal in its salient
  peculiarities, but as to the remainder, heraldry knows little if any
  distinction after the following has been properly observed. The stag,
  which is really the male red deer, has horns which are branched with
  pointed branches from the bottom to the top; but a buck, which is the
  fallow deer, has broad and flat palmated horns. Anything in the nature of
  a stag must be subject to the following terms. If lying down it is termed
  "lodged" (Fig. 379), if walking it is termed "trippant" (Fig. 380), if
  running it is termed "courant" (Fig. 381), or "at speed" or "in full
  chase." It is termed "salient" when springing (Fig. 382), though the term
  "springing" is sometimes employed, and it is said to be "at gaze" when
  statant with the head turned to face the spectator (Fig. 383); but it
  should be noted that a stag may also be "statant" (Fig. 384); and it is
  not "at gaze" unless the head is turned round. <!-- Page 209 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="241.png"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span>When it
  is necessary owing to a difference of tincture or for other reasons to
  refer to the horns, a stag or buck is described as "attired" of such and
  such a colour, whereas bulls, rams, and goats are said to be "armed."</p>

  <p>When the stag is said to be attired of ten or any other number of
  tynes, it means that there are so many points to its horns. Like other
  cloven-footed animals, the stag can be unguled of a different colour.</p>

  <p>The stag's head is very frequently met with, but it will be almost
  more frequently found as a stag's head caboshed (Fig. 385). In these
  cases the head is represented affronté and removed close behind the ears,
  so that no part of the neck is visible. The stag's head caboshed occurs
  in the arms of Cavendish and Stanley, and also in the arms of Legge, Earl
  of Dartmouth. Figs. 386 and 387 are examples of other heads.</p>

  <p>The attires of a stag are to be found either singly (as in the arms of
  Boyle) or in the form of a pair attached to the scalp. The crest of Jeune
  affords an instance of a scalp. The hind or doe (Fig. 388) is sometimes
  met with, as in the crest of Hatton, whilst a hind's head is the crest of
  Conran.</p>

  <p>The reindeer (Fig. 389) is less usual, but reindeer heads will be
  found in the arms of Fellows. It, however, appears as a supporter for
  <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum" title="242.png"><a
  name="page210"></a>{210}</span>several English peers. Winged stags (Fig.
  390) were the supporters of De Carteret, Earls of Granville, and "a
  demi-winged stag gules, collared argent," is the crest of Fox of
  Coalbrookdale, co. Salop.</p>

  <p>Much akin to the stag is the antelope, which, unless specified to be
  an <i>heraldic</i> antelope, or found in a very old coat, is usually
  represented in the natural form of the animal, and subject to the
  foregoing rules.</p>

  <p><i>Heraldic Antelope.</i>&mdash;This animal (Figs. 391, 392, and 393)
  is found in English heraldry more frequently as a supporter than as a
  charge. As an instance, however, of the latter form may be mentioned the
  family of Dighton (Lincolnshire): "Per pale argent and gules, an heraldic
  antelope passant counterchanged." It bears little if any relation to the
  real animal, though there can be but small doubt that the earliest forms
  originated in an attempt to represent an antelope or an ibex. Since,
  however, heraldry has found a use for the real antelope, it has been
  necessary to distinguish it from the creations of the early armorists,
  which are now known as heraldic antelopes. Examples will be found in the
  supporters of Lord Carew, in the crest of Moresby, and of Bagnall.</p>

  <p>The difference chiefly consists in the curious head and horns and in
  the tail, the heraldic antelope being an heraldic tiger, with the feet
  and legs similar to those of a deer, and with two straight serrated
  horns.</p>

  <p><i>Ibex.</i>&mdash;This is another form of the natural antelope, but
  with two saw-edged horns projecting from the forehead.</p>

  <p>A curious animal, namely, the sea-stag, is often met with in German
  heraldry. This is the head, antlers, fore-legs, and the upper part of the
  body of a stag conjoined to the fish-tail end of a mermaid. <!-- Page 211
  --><span class="pagenum" title="243.png"><a
  name="page211"></a>{211}</span>The only instance I am aware of in which
  it occurs in British armory is the case of the arms of Marindin, which

  origin.</p>

<h5>THE RAM AND GOAT</h5>

  <p>The ram (Figs. 395 and 396), the consideration of which must of
  necessity include the sheep (Fig. 397), the Paschal lamb (Fig. 398), and
  the fleece (Fig. 399), plays no unimportant part in armory. The chief
  heraldic difference between the ram and the sheep, to some extent, in
  opposition to the agricultural distinctions, lies in the fact that the
  ram is always represented with horns and the sheep without. The lamb and
  the ram are always represented with the natural tail, but the sheep is
  deprived of it. A ram can of course be "armed" (<i>i.e.</i> with the
  horns of a different colour) and "unguled," but the latter will seldom be
  found to be the case. The ram, the sheep, and the lamb will nearly always
  be found either passant or statant, but a demi-ram is naturally
  represented in a rampant posture, though in such a case the word
  "rampant" is not necessary in the blazon.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, as in the crest of Marwood, the ram will be found
  couchant. As a charge upon a shield the ram will be found in the arms of
  Sydenham ["Argent, three rams passant sable"], and a ram couchant occurs
  in the arms of Pujolas (granted 1762) ["Per fess wavy azure and argent,
  in base on a mount vert, a ram couchant sable, armed and unguled or, in
  chief three doves proper"]. The arms of Ramsey ["Azure, a chevron between
  three <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum" title="244.png"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>rams passant or"] and the arms of Harman
  ["Sable, a chevron between six rams counter-passant two and two argent,
  armed and unguled or"] are other instances in which rams occur. A sheep
  occurs in the arms of Sheepshanks ["Azure, a chevron erminois between in
  chief three roses and in base a sheep passant argent. Crest: on a mount
  vert, a sheep passant argent"].</p>

  <p>The lamb, which is by no means an unusual charge in Welsh coats of
  arms, is most usually found in the form of a "paschal lamb" (Fig. 398),
  or some variation evidently founded thereupon.</p>

  <p>The fleece&mdash;of course originally of great repute as the badge of
  <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum" title="245.png"><a
  name="page213"></a>{213}</span>the Order of the Golden Fleece&mdash;has
  in recent years been frequently employed in the grants of arms to towns
  or individuals connected with the woollen industry.</p>

  <p>The demi-ram and the demi-lamb are to be found as crests, but far more
  usual are rams' heads, which figure, for example, in the arms of Ramsden,
  and in the arms of the towns of Huddersfield, and Barrow-in-Furness. The
  ram's head will sometimes be found caboshed, as in the arms of Ritchie
  and Roberts.</p>

  <p>Perhaps here reference may fittingly be made to the arms granted by
  Lyon Office in 1812 to Thomas Bonar, co. Kent ["Argent, a saltire and
  chief azure, the last charged with a dexter hand proper, vested with a
  shirt-sleeve argent, issuing from the dexter chief point, holding a
  shoulder of mutton proper to a lion passant or, all within a bordure
  gules"].</p>

  <p><i>The Goat</i> (Figs. 401-403) is very frequently met with in armory.
  Its positions are passant, statant, rampant, and salient. When the horns
  are of a different colour it is said to be "armed."</p>

<h5>OTHER ANIMALS</h5>

  <p><i>The Elephant</i> is by no means unusual in heraldry, appearing as a
  crest, as a charge, and also as a supporter. Nor, strange to say, is its
  appearance exclusively modern. The elephant's head, however, is much more
  frequently met with than the entire animal. Heraldry generally finds some
  way of stereotyping one of its creations as peculiarly its own, and in
  regard to the elephant, the curious "elephant and castle" (Fig. 404) is
  an example, this latter object being, of course, simply a derivative of
  the howdah of Indian life. Few early examples of the elephant omit the
  castle. The elephant and castle is seen in the arms of Dumbarton and in
  the crest of Corbet.</p>

  <p>A curious practice, the result of pure ignorance, has manifested
  itself in British armory. As will be explained in the chapter upon
  crests, a large proportion of German crests are derivatives of the stock
  basis of two bull's horns, which formed a recognised ornament for a
  helmet in Viking and other pre-heraldic days. As heraldry found its
  footing it did not in Germany displace those horns, which in many cases
  continued alone as the crest or remained as a part of it in the form of
  additions to other objects. The craze for decoration at an early period
  seized upon the horns, which carried repetitions of the arms or their
  tinctures. As time went on the <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum" title="246.png"
  ><a name="page214"></a>{214}</span>decoration was carried further, and
  the horns were made with bell-shaped open ends to receive other objects,
  usually bunches of feathers or flowers. So universal did this custom
  become that even when nothing was inserted the horns came to be always
  depicted with these open mouths at their points. But German heraldry now,
  as has always been the case, simply terms the figures "horns." In course
  of time German immigrants made application for grants of arms in this
  country, which, doubtless, were based upon other German arms previously
  in use, but which, evidence of right not being forthcoming, could not be
  recorded as borne of right, and needed to be granted with alteration as a
  new coat. The curious result has been that these horns have been
  incorporated in some number of English grants, but they have universally
  been described as elephants' proboscides, and are now always so
  represented in this country. A case in point is the crest of Verelst, and
  another is the crest of Allhusen.</p>

  <p>Elephants' tusks have also been introduced into grants, as in the arms
  of Liebreich (borne in pretence by Cock) and Randles ["Or, a chevron wavy
  azure between three pairs of elephants' tusks in saltire proper"].</p>

  <p><i>The Hare</i> (Fig. 405) is but rarely met with in British armory.
  It appears in the arms of Cleland, and also in the crest of Shakerley,
  Bart. ["A hare proper resting her forefeet on a grab or"]. A very curious
  coat ["Argent, three hares playing bagpipes gules"] belongs to an ancient
  Derbyshire family FitzErcald, now represented (through the Sacheverell
  family) by Coke of Trussley, who quarter the FitzErcald shield.</p>

  <p><i>The Rabbit</i> (Fig. 406), or, as it is more frequently termed
  heraldically, the Coney, appears more frequently in heraldry than the
  hare, being the canting charge on the arms of Coningsby, Cunliffe
  ["Sable, three conies courant argent"], and figuring also as the
  supporters of Montgomery Cunningham ["Two conies proper"].</p>

  <p><i>The Squirrel</i> (Fig. 407) occurs in many English coats of arms.
  It is always sejant, and very frequently cracking a nut. <!-- Page 215

  name="page215"></a>{215}</span></p>

  <p><i>The Ape</i> is not often met with, except in the cases of the
  different families of the great Fitz Gerald clan. It is usually the
  crest, though the Duke of Leinster also has apes as supporters. One
  family of Fitzgerald, however, bear it as a charge upon the shield
  ["Gules, a saltire invected per pale argent and or, between four monkeys
  statant of the second, environed with a plain collar and chained of the
  second. Mantling gules and argent. Crest: on a wreath of the colours, a
  monkey as in the arms, charged on the body with two roses, and resting
  the dexter fore-leg on a saltire gules. Motto: 'Crom-a-boo'"], and the
  family of Yorke bear an ape's head for a crest.</p>

  <p>The ape is usually met with "collared and chained" (Fig. 408), though,
  unlike any other animal, the collar of an ape environs its loins and not
  its neck. A winged ape is included in Elvin's "Dictionary of Heraldry" as
  a heraldic animal, but I am not aware to whom it is assigned.</p>

  coats, but an English example is that of Sir George Newnes, and a

  <p>It is quite impossible, or at any rate very unnecessary, to turn a
  work on armory into an Illustrated Guide to Natural History, which would
  be the result if under the description of heraldic charges the attempt
  were made to deal with all the various animals which have by now been
  brought to the armorial fold, owing to the inclusion of each for special
  and sufficient reasons in one or two isolated grants.</p>

  <p>Far be it from me, however, to make any remark which should seem to
  indicate the raising of any objection to such use. In my opinion it is
  highly admirable, providing there is some definite reason in each case
  for the introduction of these strange animals other than mere caprice.
  They add to the interest of heraldry, and they give to modern arms and
  armory a definite status and meaning, which is a relief from the endless
  monotony of meaningless lions, bends, chevrons, mullets, and
  martlets.</p>

  <p>But at the same time the isolated use in a modern grant of such an
  animal as the kangaroo does not make it one of the peculiarly heraldic
  menagerie, and consequently such instances must be dismissed herein with
  brief mention, particularly as many of these creatures heraldically exist
  only as supporters, in which chapter some are more fully <!-- Page 217
  --><span class="pagenum" title="249.png"><a

  instances I know of the <i>Kangaroo</i> are in the coat of Moore and in

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XIII</h5>

<h5>MONSTERS</h5>

  <p>The heraldic catalogue of beasts runs riot when we reach those
  mythical or legendary creatures which can only be summarised under the
  generic term of monsters. Most mythical animals, however, can be traced
  back to some comparable counterpart in natural history.</p>

  <p>The fauna of the New World was of course unknown to those early
  heraldic artists in whose knowledge and imagination, no less than in
  their skill (or lack of it) in draughtsmanship, lay the nativity of so
  much of our heraldry. They certainly thought they were representing
  animals in existence in most if not in all cases, though one gathers that
  they considered many of the animals they used to be misbegotten hybrids.
  Doubtless, working on the assumption of the mule as the hybrid of the
  horse and the ass, they jumped to the conclusion that animals which
  contained salient characteristics of two other animals which they knew
  were likewise hybrids. A striking example of their theories is to be
  found in the heraldic Camelopard, which was anciently devoutly believed
  to be begotten by the leopard upon the camel. A leopard they would be
  familiar with, also the camel, for both belong to that corner of the
  world where the north-east of the African Continent, the south-east of
  Europe, and the west of Asia join, where were fought out the wars of the
  Cross, and where heraldry took on itself a definite being. There the
  known civilisations of the world met, taking one from the other
  knowledge, more or less distorted, ideas and wild imaginings. A stray
  giraffe was probably seen by some journeyer up the Nile, who, unable to
  otherwise account for it, considered and stated the animal to be the
  hybrid offspring of the leopard and camel. Another point needs to be
  borne in mind. Earlier artists were in no way fettered by any supposed
  necessity for making their pictures realistic representations. Realism is
  a modernity. Their pictures were decoration, and they thought far more of
  making their subject fit the space to be decorated than of making it a
  "speaking likeness."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, their work was not all imagination. In the
  <i>Crocodile</i> <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum" title="251.png"
  ><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span>we get the basis of the dragon, if
  indeed the heraldic dragon be not a perpetuation of ancient legends, or
  even perhaps of then existing representations of those winged
  antediluvian animals, the fossilised remains of which are now available.
  Wings, however, need never be considered a difficulty. It has ever been
  the custom (from the angels of Christianity to the personalities of
  Mercury and Pegasus) to add wings to any figure held in veneration. Why,
  it would be difficult to say, but nevertheless the fact remains.</p>

  <p><i>The Unicorn</i>, however, it is not easy to resolve into an
  original basis, because until the seventeenth century every one fondly
  believed in the existence of the animal. Mr. Beckles Wilson appears to
  have paid considerable attention to the subject, and was responsible for
  the article "The Rise of the Unicorn" which recently appeared in
  <i>Cassel's Magazine</i>. That writer traces the matter to a certain
  extent from non-heraldic sources, and the following remarks, which are
  taken from the above article, are of considerable interest:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The real genesis of the unicorn was probably this: at a time when
  armorial bearings were becoming an indispensable part of a noble's
  equipment, the attention of those knights who were fighting under the
  banner of the Cross was attracted to the wild antelopes of Syria and
  Palestine. These animals are armed with long, straight, spiral horns set
  close together, so that at a side view they appeared to be but a single
  horn. To confirm this, there are some old illuminations and drawings
  extant which endow the early unicorn with many of the attributes of the
  deer and goat kind. The sort of horn supposed to be carried by these
  Eastern antelopes had long been a curiosity, and was occasionally brought
  back as a trophy by travellers from the remote parts of the earth. There
  is a fine one to be seen to-day at the abbey of St. Denis, and others in
  various collections in Europe. We now know these so-called unicorn's
  horns, usually carved, to belong to that marine monster the narwhal, or
  sea-unicorn. But the fable of a breed of horned horses is at least as old
  as Pliny" [Had the "gnu" anything to do with this?], "and centuries later
  the Crusaders, or the monkish artists who accompanied them, attempted to
  delineate the marvel. From their first rude sketches other artists
  copied; and so each presentment was passed along, until at length the
  present form of the unicorn was attained. There was a time&mdash;not so
  long ago&mdash;when the existence of the unicorn was as implicitly
  believed in as the camel or any other animal not seen in these latitudes;
  and the translators of the Bible set their seal upon the legend by
  translating the Hebrew word <i>reem</i> (which probably meant a
  rhinoceros) as 'unicorn.' Thus the worthy Thomas Fuller came to consider
  the existence of the unicorn clearly proved by the mention of it in
  Scripture! Describing <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum" title="252.png"
  ><a name="page220"></a>{220}</span>the horn of the animal, he writes,
  'Some are plain, as that of St. Mark's in Venice; others wreathed about
  it, which probably is the effect of age, those wreaths being but the
  wrinkles of most vivacious unicorns. The same may be said of the colour:
  white when newly taken from the head; yellow, like that lately in the
  Tower, of some hundred years' seniority; but whether or no it will soon
  turn black, as that of Plinie's description, let others decide.'</p>

  <p>"All the books on natural history so late as the seventeenth century
  describe at length the unicorn; several of them carefully depict him as
  though the artist had drawn straight from the life.</p>

  <p>"If art had stopped here, the wonder of the unicorn would have
  remained but a paltry thing after all. His finer qualities would have
  been unrecorded, and all his virtues hidden. But, happily, instead of
  this, about the animal first conceived in the brain of a Greek (as
  Pegasus also was), and embodied through the fertile fancy of the
  Crusader, the monks and heraldists of the Middle Ages devised a host of
  spiritual legends. They told of his pride, his purity, his endurance, his
  matchless spirit.</p>

  <p>"'The greatnesse of his mynde is such that he chooseth rather to dye
  than be taken alive.' Indeed, he was only conquerable by a beautiful
  maiden. One fifteenth-century writer gives a recipe for catching a
  unicorn. 'A maid is set where he hunteth and she openeth her lap, to whom
  the unicorn, as seeking rescue from the force of the hunter, yieldeth his
  head and leaveth all his fierceness, and resteth himself under her
  protection, sleepeth until he is taken and slain.' But although many were
  reported to be thus enticed to their destruction, only their horns,
  strange to say, ever reached Europe. There is one in King Edward's
  collection at Buckingham Palace.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, the horn of such an animal was held a sovereign specific
  against poison, and 'ground unicorn's horn' often figures in mediæval
  books of medicine.</p>

  <p>"There was in Shakespeare's time at Windsor Castle the 'horn of a
  unicorn of above eight spans and a half in length, valued at above
  £10,000.' This may have been the one now at Buckingham Palace. One
  writer, describing it, says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I doe also know that horn the King of England possesseth to be
  wreathed in spires, even as that is accounted in the Church of St.
  Dennis, than which they suppose none greater in the world, and I never
  saw anything in any creature more worthy praise than this horne. It is of
  soe great a length that the tallest man can scarcely touch the top
  thereof, for it doth fully equal seven great feet. It weigheth thirteen
  pounds, with their assize, being only weighed by the gesse of the hands
  it seemeth much heavier.' <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum" title="253.png"
  ><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span></p>

  <p>"Spenser, in the 'Faerie Queen,' thus describes a contest between the
  unicorn and the lion:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Like as the lyon, whose imperial powre</p>
      <p>A proud rebellious unicorn defyes,</p>
      <p>T'avoide the rash assault and wrathful stowre</p>
      <p>Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applies.</p>
      <p>And when him running in full course he spyes</p>

      <p>But to the victor yields a bounteous feast.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"'It hath,' remarked Guillim, in 1600, 'been much questioned among
  naturalists which it is that is properly called the unicorn; and some
  have made doubt whether there be such a beast or no. But the great esteem
  of his horn in many places to be seen may take away that needless
  scruple.'</p>

  <p>"'These beasts are very swift, and their legs have not articles. They
  keep for the most part in the deserts, and live solitary in the tops of
  the mountaines. There was nothing more horrible than the voice or braying
  of it, for the voice is strained above measure. It fighteth both with the
  mouth and with the heeles, with the mouth biting like a lyon, and with
  the heeles kicking like a horse.'</p>

  <p>"Nor is belief in the unicorn confined to Europe. By Chinese writers
  it is characterised as a 'spiritual beast.' The existence of the unicorn
  is firmly credited by the most intelligent natives and by not a few
  Europeans. A very trustworthy observer, the Abbé Huc, speaks very
  positively on the subject: 'The unicorn really exists in Tibet.... We had
  for a long time a small Mongol treatise on Natural History, for the use
  of children, in which a unicorn formed one of the pictorial
  illustrations.'"</p>

  <p>The unicorn, however, as it has heraldically developed, is drawn <!--

  heraldic lion, the legs and feet of the deer, the head and mane of a
  horse, to which is added the long twisted horn from which the animal is
  named, and a beard (Figs. 414, 415, and 416). A good representation of
  the unicorn will be found in the figure of the Royal Arms herein, and in
  Fig. 417, which is as fine a piece of heraldic design as could be
  wished.</p>

  <p>The crest of Yonge of Colbrooke, Devonshire, is "a demi-sea-unicorn
  argent, armed gules, finned or," and the crest of Tynte (Kemeys-Tynte of
  Cefn Mably and Halswell) is "on a mount vert, a unicorn sejant argent,
  armed and crined or."</p>

  <p>The unicorn will be found in the arms of Styleman, quartered by Le
  Strange, and Swanzy.</p>

  <p><i>The Griffin</i> or <i>Gryphon</i>.&mdash;Though in the popular mind
  any heraldic monster is generically termed a griffin, the griffin has,
  nevertheless, very marked and distinct peculiarities. It is one of the
  hybrid monstrosities which heraldry is so fond of, and is formed by the
  body, hind-legs, and tail of a lion conjoined to the head and claws of an
  eagle, the latter acting as its forepaws (Figs. 418-420). It has the
  wings of the eagle, which are never represented close, but it also has
  ears, and this, by the way, should be noted, because herein is the only
  distinction between a griffin's head and an eagle's head when the rest of
  the body is not represented (Fig. 421). Though but very seldom so met
  with, it is occasionally found proper, by which description is meant that
  the plumage is of the brown colour of the eagle, the rest of the body
  being the natural colour of the lion. The griffin is frequently found
  with its beak and fore-legs of a different colour from its body, <!--
  Page 223 --><span class="pagenum" title="257.png"><a
  name="page223"></a>{223}</span>and is then termed "armed," though another
  term, "beaked and fore-legged," is almost as frequently used. A very
  popular idea is that the origin of the griffin was the dimidiation of two
  coats of arms, one having an eagle and the other a lion as charges, but
  taking the origin of armory to belong to about the end of the eleventh
  century, or thereabouts, the griffin can be found as a distinct creation,
  not necessarily heraldic, at a very much earlier date. An exceedingly
  good and an early representation of the griffin will be found in Fig.
  422. It is a representation of the great seal of the town of Schweidnitz
  in the jurisdiction of Breslau, and belongs to the year 1315. The
  inscription is "+ S universitatis civium de Swidnitz." In the grant of
  arms to the town in the year 1452, the griffin is gules on a field of
  argent.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:38%;">
      <a href="images/fig422.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig422.png"

  </div>

  <p>The griffin will be found in all sorts of positions, and the terms
  applied to it are the same as would be applied to a lion, except in the
  single instance of the rampant position. A griffin is then termed
  "segreant" (Fig. 418). The wings are usually represented as endorsed and
  erect, but this is not compulsory, as will be noticed by reference to the
  supporters of the Earl of Mar and Kellie, in which the wings are
  inverted.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    423.</span>&mdash;Male gryphon.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is a certain curiosity in English heraldry, wholly peculiar to
  it, which may be here referred to. A griffin in the ordinary way is
  merely so termed, but a male griffin by some curious reasoning has no
  wings, but is adorned with spikes showing at some number of points on its
  body (Fig. 423). I have, under my remarks upon the panther, hazarded the
  supposition that the male griffin of English heraldry is nothing more
  than a British development and form of the Continental heraldic panther
  which is unknown to us. The origin of the clusters and spikes, unless
  they are to be found in the flames of fire associated with the panther,
  must remain a mystery. The male griffin is very seldom met with, but two
  of these creatures are the supporters of Sir George John Egerton
  Dashwood, Bart. Whilst we consider the griffin a purely mythical animal,
  there is no doubt whatever that earlier writers devoutly believed that
  such animals existed. Sir John Maundeville tells us in his "Travels" that
  they abound in Bacharia. "Sum men seyn that thei han the body upward as
  an egle, and benethe as a lyoun; and treuly thei seyn sothe that thei ben
  of that schapp. But a Griffoun <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum" title="258.png"
  ><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>hathe the body more gret and more
  strong than eight lyouns of such lyouns as ben o' this half (of the
  world), and more gret and stronger than an 100 egles such as we han
  amonges us ...," and other writers, whilst not considering them an
  original type of animal, undoubtedly believed in their existence as
  hybrid of the eagle and the lion. It is of course a well-known fact that
  the mule, the most popular hybrid, does not breed. This fact would be
  accepted as accounting for the rarity of animals which were considered to
  be hybrids.</p>

  <p>Though there are examples of griffins in some of the earliest rolls of
  arms, the animal cannot be said to have come into general use until a
  somewhat later period. Nowadays, however, it is probably next in
  popularity to the lion.</p>

  <p>The demi-griffin is very frequently found as a crest.</p>

  <p>A griffin's head (Fig. 421) is still yet more frequently met with, and
  as a charge upon the shields it will be found in the arms of Raikes, Kay,
  and many other families.</p>

  <p>A variety of the griffin is found in the gryphon-marine, or
  sea-griffin. In it the fore part of the creature is that of the eagle,
  but the wings are sometimes omitted; and the lower half of the animal is
  that of a fish, or rather of a mermaid. Such a creature is the charge in
  the arms of the Silesian family of Mestich: "Argent, a sea-griffin
  proper" (Siebmacher, <i>Wappenbuch</i>, i. 69). "Azure, a (winged)
  sea-griffin per fesse gules and argent crowned or," is the coat of the
  Barons von Puttkammer. One or two other Pomeranian families have the like
  charge without wings.</p>

  <p><i>The Dragon.</i>&mdash;Much akin to the griffin is the dragon, but
  the similarity of appearance is more superficial than real, inasmuch as
  in all details it differs, except in the broad similarity that it has
  four legs, a pair of wings, and is a terrible creature. The much referred
  to "griffin" opposite the Law Courts in the Strand is really a dragon.
  The head of a dragon is like nothing else in heraldry, and from what
  source it originated or what basis existed for ancient heraldic artists
  to imagine it from must remain a mystery, unless it has developed from
  the crocodile or some antediluvian animal much akin. It is like nothing
  else in heaven or on earth. Its neck is covered with scales not unlike
  those of a fish. All four legs are scaled and have claws, the back is
  scaled, the tongue is barbed, and the under part of the body is likewise
  scaled, but here, in rolls of a much larger size. Great differences will
  be found in the shape of the ears, but the wings of the dragon are always
  represented as the wings of a bat, with the long ribs or bones carried to
  the base (Figs. 424-426). The dragon is one of the most artistic of
  heraldic creations, and lends itself very readily to the genius of any
  artist. In nearly all modern representations the tail, like the tongue,
  <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum" title="259.png"><a
  name="page225"></a>{225}</span>will be found ending in a barb, but it
  should be observed that this is a comparatively recent addition. All
  dragons of the Tudor period were invariably represented without any such
  additions to their tails. The tail was long and smooth, ending in a blunt
  point.</p>

  <p>Whilst we have separate and distinct names for many varieties of
  dragon-like creatures, other countries in their use of the word "dragon"
  include the wyvern, basilisk, cockatrice, and other similar creatures,
  but the distinct name in German heraldry for our four-footed dragon is
  the <i>Lindwurm</i>, and Fig. 427 is a representation of the dragon
  according to German ideas, which nevertheless might form an example for
  English artists to copy, except that we very seldom represent ours as
  coward.</p>

  achievement as the badge of Wales, is known as the red dragon of
  Cadwallader, and in deference to a loudly expressed sentiment on the
  subject, His Majesty the King has recently added the Welsh dragon
  differenced by a label of three points argent as an additional badge to
  the achievement of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. The red dragon
  was one of the supporters of the Tudor kings, being used by Henry VII.,
  Henry VIII., and Edward VI. Queen Elizabeth, however, whose liking for
  gold is evidenced by her changing the Royal mantle from gules and ermine
  to gold and ermine, also changed the colour of the dragon as her
  supporter to gold, and many Welsh scholars hold that the ruddy dragon of
  Wales was and should be of ruddy gold and not of gules. There is some
  room for doubt whether the dragon in the Royal Arms was really of Welsh
  origin. The point was discussed at some length by the present writer <!--
  Page 226 --><span class="pagenum" title="260.png"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span>in the <i>Genealogical Magazine</i>
  (October 1902). It was certainly in use by King Henry III.</p>

  <p>A dragon may be statant (Fig. 426), rampant (Fig. 424), or passant
  (Fig. 425), and the crests of Bicknell and of the late Sir Charles Young,
  Garter King of Arms, are examples of dragons couchant.</p>

  <p>A sea-dragon, whatever that creature may be, occurs in one of the
  crests of Mr. Mainwaring-Ellerker-Onslow.</p>

  <p>Variations such as that attributed to the family of Raynor ["Argent, a
  dragon volant in bend sable"], the dragon overthrown on the arms of
  Langridge as quartered by Lowdell, and the sinister supporter of the arms
  of Viscount Gough ["The dragon of China or gorged with a mural crown and
  chained sable"] may be noted. The Chinese dragon, which is also the
  dexter supporter of Sir Robert Hart, Bart., follows closely the Chinese
  model, and is without wings.</p>

  <p><i>The Wyvern.</i>&mdash;There is no difference whatever between a
  wyvern's head and a dragon's, but there is considerable difference
  between a wyvern and a dragon, at any rate in English heraldry, though
  the wyvern appears to be the form more frequently met with under the name
  of a dragon in other countries. The wyvern has only two legs, the body
  curling away into the tail, and it is usually represented as resting upon
  its legs and tail (Figs. 428 and 429). On the other hand, it will
  occasionally be found sitting erect upon its tail with its claws in the
  air (Fig. 430), and the supporters of the Duke of Marlborough are
  generally so represented. As a charge or crest, however, probably the
  only instance of a wyvern sejant erect is the crest of Mansergh. A
  curious crest also is that of Langton, namely: "On a wreath of the
  colours, an eagle or and a wyvern vert, interwoven and erect on their
  tails," and an equally curious one is the crest of Maule, <i>i.e.</i> "A
  wyvern vert, with two heads vomiting fire at both ends proper, charged
  with a crescent argent."</p>

  <p>Occasionally the wyvern is represented without wings and with the <!--
  Page 227 --><span class="pagenum" title="261.png"><a
  name="page227"></a>{227}</span>tail nowed. Both these peculiarities occur
  in the case of the crest of a Lancashire family named Ffarington.</p>

  <p><i>The Cockatrice.</i>&mdash;The next variety is the cockatrice (Fig.
  431), which is, however, comparatively rare. Two cockatrices are the
  supporters to the arms of the Earl of Westmeath, and also to the arms of
  Sir Edmund Charles Nugent, Bart. But the animal is not common as a
  charge. The difference between a wyvern and a cockatrice is that the
  latter has the head of a cock substituted for the dragon's head with
  which the wyvern is decorated. Like the cock, the beak, comb, and wattles
  are often of another tincture, and the animal is then termed armed,
  combed, and wattled.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig431.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig431.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    431.</span>&mdash;Cockatrice.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The cockatrice is sometimes termed a <i>basilisk</i>, and according to
  ancient writers the basilisk is produced from an egg laid by a
  nine-year-old cock and hatched by a toad on a dunghill. Probably this is
  merely the expression of the intensified loathing which it was desired to
  typify. But the heraldic basilisk is stated to have its tail terminating
  in a dragon's head. In English heraldry, at any rate, I know of no such
  example.</p>

  <p><i>The Hydra</i>, or <i>Seven-headed Dragon</i>, as the crest, is
  ascribed to the families of Barret, Crespine, and Lownes.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig432.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig432.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    432.</span>&mdash;Camelopard.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Camelopard</i> (Fig. 432), which is nothing more or less than
  an ordinary giraffe, must be properly included amongst mythical animals,
  because the form and semblance of the giraffe was used to represent a
  mythical hybrid creation which the ancients believed to be begotten
  between a leopard and a camel. Possibly they represented the real giraffe
  (which they may have known), taking that to be a hybrid between the two
  animals stated. It occurs as the crest of several coats of arms for the
  name of Crisp.</p>

  <p><i>The Camelopardel</i>, which is another mythical animal fathered
  upon armory, is stated to be the same as the camelopard, but with the
  addition of two long horns curved backwards. I know of no instance in
  which it occurs.</p>

  <p>The human face or figure conjoined to some other animal's body gives
  us a number of heraldic creatures, some of which play no inconsiderable
  part in armory.</p>

  <p>The human figure (male) conjoined to the tail of a fish is known as
  the <i>Triton</i> or <i>Merman</i> (Fig. 433). Though there are some
  number of instances in which it occurs as a supporter, it is seldom met
  with as <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum" title="262.png"><a
  name="page228"></a>{228}</span>a charge upon a shield. It is, however, to
  be found in the arms of Otway, and is assigned as a crest to the family
  of Tregent, and a family of Robertson, of London.</p>

  <p><i>The Mermaid</i> (Fig. 434), is much more frequently met with. It is
  generally represented with the traditional mirror and comb in the hands.
  It will be found appearing, for example, in the arms of Ellis, of
  Glasfryn, co. Monmouth. The crest of Mason, used without authority by the
  founder of Mason's College, led to its inclusion in the arms of the
  University of Birmingham. It will also be found as the crest of
  Rutherford and many other families.</p>

  <p><i>The Melusine, i.e.</i> a mermaid with two tails disposed on either
  side, though not unknown in British heraldry, is more frequent in
  German.</p>

</td></tr></table>

  <p><i>The Sphinx</i>, of course originally derived from the Egyptian
  figure, has the body, legs, and tail of a lion conjoined to the breasts,
  head, and face of a woman (Fig. 435). As a charge it occurs in the arms
  of Cochrane and Cameron of Fassiefern. This last-mentioned coat affords a
  striking example of the over-elaboration to be found in so many of the
  grants which owe their origin to the Peninsular War and the other
  "fightings" in which England was engaged at the period. A winged sphinx
  is the crest of a family of the name of Asgile. Two sphinxes were granted
  as supporters to the late Sir Edward Malet, G.C.B.</p>

  <p><i>The Centaur</i> (Fig. 436)&mdash;the familiar fabulous animal, half
  man, half horse&mdash;is sometimes represented carrying a bow and arrow,
  when it is called a "sagittarius." It is not infrequently met with in
  heraldry, though it is to be found more often in Continental than in
  English blazonry. In its "sagittarius" form it is sculptured on a column
  in the Romanesque cloister of St. Aubin at Angers. It will be found as
  the crest of most families named Lambert, and it was one of the
  supporters of <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum" title="263.png"><a
  name="page229"></a>{229}</span>Lord Hood of Avelon. It is also the crest
  of a family of Fletcher. A very curious crest was borne by a family of
  Lambert, and is to be seen on their monuments. They could establish no
  official authority for their arms as used, and consequently obtained
  official authorisation in the early part of the eighteenth century, when
  the crest then granted was a regulation sagittarius, but up to that time,
  however, they had always used a "female centaur" holding a rose in its
  dexter hand.</p>

  <p><i>Chimera.</i>&mdash;This legendary animal happily does not figure in
  English heraldry, and but rarely abroad. It is described as having the
  head and breast of a woman, the forepaws of a lion, the body of a goat,
  the hind-legs of a griffin, and the tail of a dragon, and would be about
  as ugly and misbegotten a creature as can readily be imagined.</p>

  <p><i>The Man-Lion</i> will be found referred to under the heading of
  lions, and Elvin mentions in addition the <i>Weir-Wolf, i.e.</i> the wolf
  with a human face and horns. Probably this creature has strayed into
  heraldic company by mistake. I know of no armorial use of it.</p>

  <p><i>The Satyr</i>, which has a well-established existence in other than
  heraldic sources of imagination, is composed of a demi-savage united to
  the hind-legs of a goat.</p>

  <p><i>The Satyral</i> is a hybrid animal having the body of a lion and
  the face of an old man, with the horns of an antelope. I know of no
  instance of its use.</p>

  <p><i>The Harpy</i>&mdash;which is a curious creature consisting of the
  head, neck, and breasts of a woman conjoined to the wings and body of a
  vulture&mdash;is peculiarly German, though it does exist in the heraldry
  of this country. The German name for it is the <i>Jungfraunadler</i>. The
  shield of the Rietbergs, Princes of Ost-Friesland, is: "Sable, a harpy
  crowned, and with wings displayed all proper, between four stars, two in
  chief and as many in base or." The harpy will be found as a crest in this
  country.</p>

  <p><i>The Devil</i> is not, as may be imagined, a favourite heraldic
  charge. The arms of Sissinks of Groningen, however, are: "Or, a horned
  devil having six paws, the body terminating in the tail of a fish all
  gules." The family of Bawde have for a crest: "A satyr's head in profile
  sable, with wings to the side of the head or, the tongue hanging out of
  his mouth gules." Though so blazoned, I feel sure it is really intended
  to represent a fiend. On the Garter Hall-plate of John de Grailly, Captal
  de Buch, the crest is a man's head with ass's ears. This is, however,
  usually termed a Midas' head. A certain coat of arms which is given in
  the "General Armory" under the name of Dannecourt, and also under the
  name of Morfyn or Murfyn, has for a crest: "A blackamoor's head couped at
  the shoulders, habited paly of six ermine and ermines, pendents in his
  ears or, wreathed about the <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum" title="264.png"
  ><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>forehead, with bat's wings to the head
  sable, expanded on each side."</p>

  <p>Many mythical animals can be more conveniently considered under their
  natural counterparts. Of these the notes upon the heraldic antelope and
  the heraldic ibex accompany those upon the natural antelope, and the
  heraldic panther is included with the real animal. The heraldic tiger,
  likewise, is referred to concurrently with the Bengal or natural tiger.
  The pegasus, the sea-horse, and the winged sea-horse are mentioned with
  other examples of the horse, and the sea-dog is included with other
  breeds and varieties of that useful animal. The winged bull, of which
  only one instance is known to me, occurs as the supporters of the
  Butchers' Livery Company, and has been already alluded to, as also the
  winged stag. The sea-stag is referred to under the sub-heading of stags.
  The two-headed lion, the double-queued lion, the lion queue-fourché, the
  sea-lion (which is sometimes found winged) are all included in the
  chapter upon lions, as are also the winged lion and the lion-dragon. The
  winged ape was mentioned when considering the natural animal, and perhaps
  it may be as well to allude to the asserted heraldic existence of the
  sea-monkey, though I am not aware of any instance in which it is
  borne.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    437.</span>&mdash;Salamander.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The arms of Challoner afford an instance of the <i>Sea-Wolf</i>, the
  crest of that family being: "A demi-sea-wolf rampant or." Guillim,
  however (p. 271), in quoting the arms of Fennor, would seem to assert the
  sea-wolf and sea-dog to be one and the same. They certainly look rather
  like each other.</p>

  <p><i>The Ph&oelig;nix</i> and the <i>Double-headed Eagle</i> will
  naturally be more conveniently dealt with in the chapter upon the
  eagle.</p>

  <p><i>The Salamander</i> has been represented in various ways, and is
  usually described as a dragon in flames of fire. It is sometimes so
  represented but without wings, though it more usually follows the shape
  of a lizard.</p>

  <p>The salamander is, however, best known as the personal device of
  Francis I., King of France. It is to this origin that the arms of the
  city of Paris can be traced.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the list of heraldic monsters can be very briefly
  dismissed. In many cases a good deal of research has failed to discover
  an instance of their use, and one is almost inclined to believe that they
  were invented by those mediæval writers of prolific imagination for their
  treatises, without ever having been borne or emblazoned upon helmet or
  shield.</p>

  <p><i>The Allocamelus</i> is supposed to have the head of an ass
  conjoined <!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum" title="265.png"><a
  name="page231"></a>{231}</span>to the body of a camel. I cannot call to
  mind any British instance of its use.</p>

  <p><i>The Amphiptère</i> is the term applied to a "winged serpent," a
  charge of but rare occurrence in either English or foreign heraldry. It
  is found in the arms of the French family of Potier, viz.: "Azure, a
  bendlet purpure between two amphiptères or," while they figure as
  supporters also in that family, and in those of the Ducs de Tresmes and
  De Gevres.</p>

  <p><i>The Apres</i> is an animal with the body similar to that of a bull,
  but with a bear's tail. It is seldom met with outside heraldic
  text-books.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig438.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig438.png"

  </div>

  <p><i>The Amphisb&oelig;na</i> is usually described as a winged serpent
  (with two legs) having a head at each end of its body, but in the crest
  of Gwilt ["On a saltire or, interlaced by two amphisb&oelig;næ azure,
  langued gules, a rose of the last, barbed and seeded proper"] the
  creatures certainly do not answer to the foregoing description. They must
  be seen to be duly appreciated.</p>

  <p><i>The Cockfish</i> is a very unusual charge, but it is to be met with
  in the arms of the family of Geyss, in Bavaria, <i>i.e.</i>: "Or, a cock
  sable, beaked of the first, crested and armed gules, its body ending in
  that of a fish curved upwards, proper."</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    439.</span>&mdash;Opinicus.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Enfield</i> (Fig. 438) is a purely fanciful animal, having the
  head of a fox, chest of a greyhound, talons of an eagle, body of a lion,
  and hind legs and tail of a wolf. It occurs as the crest of most Irish
  families of the name of Kelly.</p>

  <p><i>The Bagwyn</i> is an imaginary animal with the head of and much
  like the heraldic antelope, but with the body and tail of a horse, and
  the horns long and curved backwards. It is difficult to say what it is
  intended to represent, and I can give no instance in which it occurs.</p>

  <p><i>The Musimon</i> is a fabulous animal with the body and feet of a
  goat and the head of a ram, with four horns. It is supposed to be the
  hybrid between the ram and the goat, the four horns being the two
  straight ones of the goat and the two curled ones of the ram. Though no
  heraldic instance is known to me, one cannot definitely say such an
  animal never existed. Another name for it is the tityron.</p>

  <p><i>The Opinicus</i> (Fig. 439) is another monster seldom met with in
  armory. When it does occur it is represented as a winged gryphon, with a
  lion's legs and short tail. Another description of it gives it the <!--
  Page 232 --><span class="pagenum" title="266.png"><a
  name="page232"></a>{232}</span>body and forelegs of a lion, the head,
  neck, and wings of an eagle, and the tail of a camel. It is the crest of
  the Livery Company of Barbers in London, which doubtless gives us the
  origin of it in the recent grant of arms to Sir Frederick Treves, Bart.
  Sometimes the wings are omitted.</p>

  <p><i>The Manticora</i>, <i>Mantegre</i>, or <i>Man-Tiger</i> is the same
  as the man-lion, but has horns attached to its forehead.</p>

  <p><i>The Hippogriff</i> has the head, wings and foreclaws of the griffin
  united to the hinder part of the body of a horse.</p>

  <p><i>The Calopus</i> or <i>Chatloup</i> is a curious horned animal
  difficult to describe, but which appears to have been at one time the
  badge of the Foljambe family. No doubt, as the name would seem to
  indicate, it is a variant of the wolf.</p>

  <p>Many of the foregoing animals, particularly those which are or are
  supposed to be hybrids, are, however well they may be depicted, ugly,
  inartistic, and unnecessary. Their representation leaves one with a
  disappointed feeling of crudity of draughtmanship. No such objection
  applies to the pegasus, the griffin, the sea-horse, the dragon, or the
  unicorn, and in these modern days, when the differentiation of well-worn
  animals is producing singularly inept results, one would urge that the
  sea-griffin, the sea-stag, the winged bull, the winged stag, the winged
  lion, and winged heraldic antelope might produce (if the necessity of
  differentiation continue) very much happier results. <!-- Page 233

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XIV</h5>

<h5>BIRDS</h5>

  <p>Birds of course play a large and prominent part in heraldry. Those
  which have been impressed into the service of heraldic emblazonment
  comprise almost every species known to the zoological world.</p>

  <p>Though the earliest rolls of arms give us instances of various other
  birds, the bird which makes the most prominent appearance is the
  <i>Eagle</i>, and in all early representations this will invariably be
  found "displayed." A double-headed eagle displayed, from a Byzantine silk
  of the tenth century, is illustrated by Mr. Eve in his "Decorative
  Heraldry," so that it is evident that neither the eagle displayed nor the
  double-headed eagle originated with the science of armory, which
  appropriated them ready-made, together with their symbolism. An eagle
  displayed as a symbolical device was certainly in use by Charlemagne.</p>

  <p>It may perhaps here be advantageous to treat of the artistic
  development of the eagle displayed. Of this, of course, the earliest
  prototype is the Roman eagle of the Cæsars, and it will be to English
  eyes, accustomed to our conventional spread-eagle, doubtless rather
  startling to observe that the German type of the eagle, which follows the
  Roman disposition of the wings (which so many of our heraldic artists at
  the present day appear inclined to adopt either in the accepted German or
  in a slightly modified form as an eagle displayed) is certainly not a
  true displayed eagle according to our English ideas and requirements,
  inasmuch as the wings are inverted. It should be observed that in German
  heraldry it is simply termed an eagle, and not an eagle displayed.
  Considering, however, its very close resemblance to our eagle displayed,
  and also its very artistic appearance, there is every excuse for its
  employment in this country, and I for one should be sorry to observe its
  slowly increasing favour checked in this country. It is quite possible,
  however, to transfer the salient and striking points of beauty to the
  more orthodox position of the wings. The eagle (compared with the lion
  and the ordinaries) had no such predominance in early British heraldry
  that it enjoyed in Continental armory, and therefore it may be better to
  trace the artistic development of the German eagle. <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum" title="268.png"><a
  name="page234"></a>{234}</span></p>

  <p>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the eagle appears with the
  head raised and the beak closed. The <i>sachsen</i> (bones of the wings)
  are rolled up at the ends like a snail, and the pinions (like the talons)
  take a vertical downward direction. The tail, composed of a number of
  stiff feathers, frequently issues from a knob or ball. Compare Fig. 440
  herewith.</p>

  <p>With the end of the fourteenth century the head straightens itself,
  the beak opens and the tongue becomes visible. The rolling up of the
  wing-bones gradually disappears, and the claws form an acute angle with
  the direction of the body; and at this period the claws occasionally
  receive the "hose" covering the upper part of the leg. The feathers of
  the tail spread out sicklewise (Fig. 441).</p>

  <p>The fifteenth century shows the eagle with <i>sachsen</i> forming a
  half circle, the pinions spread out and radiating therefrom, and the
  claws more at a right angle (Fig. 442). The sixteenth century draws the
  eagle in a more ferocious aspect, and depicts it in as ornamental and
  ornate a manner as possible.</p>

  <p>From Konrad Grünenberg's <i>Wappenbuch</i> (Constance, 1483) is
  reproduced the shield (Fig. 443) with the boldly sketched <i>Adlerflügel
  mit Schwerthand</i> (eagle's wing with the sword hand), the supposed arms
  of the Duke of Calabria.</p>

  <p>Quite in the same style is the eagle of Tyrol on a corporate flag of
  the Society of the Schwazer Bergbute (Fig. 444), which belongs to the
  last quarter of the fifteenth century. This is reproduced from the
  impression in the Bavarian National Museum given in Hefner-Alteneck's
  "Book of Costumes."</p>

  <p>A modern German eagle drawn by H. G. Ströhl is shown in Fig. 445. The
  illustration is of the arms of the Prussian province of Brandenburg.</p>

  <p>The double eagle has, of course, undergone a somewhat similar
  development.</p>

  <p>The double eagle occurs in the East as well as in the West in very
  early times. Since about 1335 the double eagle has appeared sporadically
  as a symbol of the Roman-German Empire, and under the Emperor Sigismund
  (<i>d.</i> 1447) became the settled armorial device of the Roman Empire.
  King Sigismund, before his coronation as Emperor, bore the single-headed
  eagle.</p>

  <p>It may perhaps be as well to point out, with the exception of the two
  positions "displayed" (Fig. 451) and "close" (Fig. 446), very little if
  any agreement at all exists amongst authorities either as to the terms to
  be employed or as to the position intended for the wings when a given
  term is used in a blazon. Practically every other single position is
  simply blazoned "rising," this term being employed without any additional
  distinctive terms of variation in official blazons and emblazonments. Nor
  can one obtain any certain information from a reference to the real
  eagle, for the result of careful observation would seem to show that in
  the first stroke of the wings, when rising from the ground, the wings
  pass through every position from the wide outstretched form, which I term
  "rising with wings elevated and displayed" (Fig. 450), to a position
  practically "close." As a consequence, therefore, no one form can be said
  to be more correct than any other, either from the point of view of
  nature or from the point of view of ancient precedent. This state of
  affairs is eminently unsatisfactory, because in these days of necessary
  differentiation no heraldic artist of any appreciable knowledge or
  ability has claimed the liberty (which certainly has not been officially
  conceded) to depict an eagle rising with wings elevated and displayed,
  when it has been granted with the wings in the position addorsed and
  inverted. Such a liberty when the wings happen to be charged, as they so
  frequently are in modern English crests, must clearly be an
  impossibility. <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum" title="270.png"><a

  <p>Until some agreement has been arrived at, I can only recommend my
  readers to follow the same plan which I have long adopted in blazoning
  arms of which the official blazon has not been available to me. That is,
  to use the term "rising," followed by the necessary description of the
  position of the wings (Figs. 447-450). This obviates both mistake and
  uncertainty. Originally with us, as still in Germany, an eagle was always
  displayed, and in the days when coats of arms were few in number and
  simple in character the artist may well have been permitted to draw an
  eagle as he chose, providing it was an eagle. But arms and their
  elaboration in the last four hundred years have made this impossible. It
  is foolish to overlook this, and idle in the face of existing facts to
  attempt to revert to former ways. Although now the English eagle
  displayed has the tip of its wings pointed upwards (Fig. 451), and the
  contrary needs now to be mentioned in the blazon (Fig. 452), this even
  with us was not so in the beginning. A reference to Figs. 453 and 454
  will show how the eagle was formerly depicted.</p>

  <p>The earliest instance of the eagle as a definitely heraldic charge
  upon a shield would appear to be its appearance upon the Great Seal of
  the Markgrave Leopold of Austria in 1136, where the equestrian figure of
  the Markgrave carries a shield so charged. More or less regularly,
  subsequently to the reign of Frederick Barbarossa, elected King of the
  Romans in 1152, and crowned as Emperor in 1155, the eagle with one or two
  heads (there seems originally to have been little unanimity upon the
  point) seems to have become the recognised heraldic symbol of the Holy
  Roman Empire; and the seal of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, elected King of
  the Romans in 1257, shows his arms ["Argent, a lion rampant gules, within
  a bordure sable, bezanté"] displayed upon the breast of an eagle; but no
  properly authenticated contemporary instance of the use of this eagle by
  the Earl of Cornwall is found in this country. The origin of the
  double-headed eagle (Fig. 455) has been the subject of endless
  controversy, the tale one is usually taught to believe being that it
  originated in the dimidiation upon one shield of two separate coats <!--
  Page 238 --><span class="pagenum" title="272.png"><a
  name="page238"></a>{238}</span>of arms. Nisbet states that the Imperial
  eagle was "not one eagle with two heads, but two eagles, the one laid
  upon the other, and their heads separate, looking different ways, which
  represent the two heads of the Empire after it was divided into East and
  West." The whole discussion is an apt example of the habit of earlier
  writers to find or provide hidden meanings and symbolisms when no such
  meanings existed. The real truth undoubtedly is that the double-headed
  eagle was an accepted figure long before heraldry came into existence,
  and that when the displayed eagle was usurped by armory as one of its
  peculiarly heraldic figures, the single-headed and double-headed
  varieties were used indifferently, until the double-headed eagle became
  stereotyped as the Imperial emblem. Napoleon, however, reverted to the
  single-headed eagle, and the present German Imperial eagle has likewise
  only one head.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig456.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig456.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    456.</span>&mdash;Napoleonic Eagle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Imperial eagle of Napoleon had little in keeping with then
  existing armorial types of the bird. There can be little doubt that the
  model upon which it was based was the Roman Eagle of the Cæsars as it
  figured upon the head of the Roman standards. In English terms of blazon
  the Napoleonic eagle would be: "An eagle displayed with wings inverted,
  the head to the sinister, standing upon a thunderbolt or" (Fig. 456).</p>

  <p>The then existing double-headed eagles of Austria and Russia probably
  supply the reason why, when the German Empire was created, the Prussian
  eagle in a modified form was preferred to the resuscitation of the older
  double-headed eagle, which had theretofore been more usually accepted as
  the symbol of Empire.</p>

  <p>By the same curious idea which was noticed in the earlier chapter upon
  lions, and which ruled that the mere fact of the appearance of two or
  more lions rampant in the same coat of arms made them into lioncels, so
  more than one eagle upon a shield resulted sometimes in the birds
  becoming eaglets. Such a rule has never had official recognition, and no
  artistic difference is made between the eagle and the eaglet. The charges
  on the arms of Piers Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall, are blazoned as eagles
  (Fig. 454). In the blazon of a few coats of arms, the term eaglet,
  however, still survives, <i>e.g.</i> in the arms of Child ["Gules a
  chevron ermine, between three eaglets close argent"], and in the arms of
  Smitheman ["Vert, three eaglets statant with wings displayed argent,
  collared or"].</p>

  <p>When an eagle has its beak of another colour, it is termed "armed" of
  that colour, and when the legs differ it is termed "membered." <!-- Page
  239 --><span class="pagenum" title="273.png"><a
  name="page239"></a>{239}</span></p>

  <p>An eagle volant occurs in the crest of Jessel ["On a wreath of the
  colours, a torch fesswise, fired proper, surmounted by an eagle volant
  argent, holding in the beak a pearl also argent. Motto:
  'Persevere'"].</p>

  <p>Parts of an eagle are almost as frequently met with as the entire
  bird. Eagles' heads (Fig. 457) abound as crests (they can be
  distinguished from the head of a griffin by the fact that the latter has
  always upstanding ears).</p>

  </div>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified (<i>e.g.</i> the crest of the late Sir Noel
  Paton was between the two wings of a dove), wings occurring in armory are
  always presumed to be the wings of an eagle. This, however, in English
  heraldry has little effect upon their design, for probably any
  well-conducted eagle (as any other bird) would disown the English
  heraldic wing, as it certainly would never recognise the German heraldic
  variety. A pair of wings when displayed and conjoined at the base is
  termed "conjoined in leure" (Fig. 458), from the palpable similarity of
  the figure in its appearance to the lure with which, thrown into the air,
  the falconer brought back his hawk to hand. The best known, and most
  frequently quoted instance, is the well-known coat of Seymour or St. Maur
  ["Gules, two wings conjoined in leure the tips downwards or"]. It should
  always be stated if the wings (as in the arms of Seymour) are inverted.
  Otherwise the tips are naturally presumed to be in chief.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 458.</span>&mdash;A
    pair of wings conjoined in leure.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Pairs of wings not conjoined can be met with in the arms and crest of
  Burne-Jones ["Azure, on a bend sinister argent between seven mullets,
  four in chief and three in base or, three pairs of wings addorsed
  purpure, charged with a mullet or. Crest: in front of fire proper two
  wings elevated and addorsed purpure, charged with a mullet or"]; but two
  wings, unless conjoined or addorsed, will not usually be described as a
  pair. Occasionally, however, a pair of wings will be found in saltire,
  but such a disposition is most unusual. Single wings, unless specified to
  be the contrary, are presumed to be dexter wings.</p>

  <p>Care needs to be exercised in some crests to observe the difference
  between (<i>a</i>) a bird's head between two wings, (<i>b</i>) a bird's
  head winged (a form not often met with, but in which rather more of the
  neck is shown, and the wings are conjoined thereto), and (<i>c</i>) a
  bird's head between two wings addorsed. The latter form, which of course
  is really <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum" title="274.png"><a
  name="page240"></a>{240}</span>no more than a representation of a crest
  between two wings turned to be represented upon a profile helmet, is one
  of the painful results of our absurd position rules for the helmet.</p>

  <p>A pair of wings conjoined is sometimes termed a vol, and one wing a
  demi-vol. Though doubtless it is desirable to know these terms, they are
  but seldom found in use, and are really entirely French.</p>

  <p>Eagles' legs are by no means an infrequent charge. They will usually
  be found erased at the thigh, for which there is a recognised term
  "erased à la quise" (Fig. 459), which, however, is by no means a
  compulsory one. An eagle's leg so erased was a badge of the house of
  Stanley. The eagle's leg will sometimes be met with couped below the
  feathers, but would then be more properly described as a claw.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    460.</span>&mdash;Ph&oelig;nix.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A curious form of the eagle is found in the <i>alerion</i>, which is
  represented without beak or legs. It is difficult to conjecture what may
  have been the origin of the bird in this debased form, unless its first
  beginnings may be taken as a result of the unthinking perpetuation of
  some crudely drawn example. Its best-known appearance is, of course, in
  the arms of Loraine; and as Planché has pointed out, this is as perfect
  an example of a canting anagram as can be met with in armory.</p>

  <p><i>The Ph&oelig;nix</i> (Fig. 460), one of the few mythical birds
  which heraldry has familiarised us with, is another, and perhaps the most
  patent example of all, of the appropriation by heraldic art of an ancient
  symbol, with its symbolism ready made. It belongs to the period of
  Grecian mythology. As a charge upon a shield it is comparatively rare,
  though it so occurs in the arms of Samuelson. On the other hand, it is
  frequently to be found as a crest. It is always represented as a
  demi-eagle issuing from flames of fire, and though the flames of fire
  will generally be found mentioned in the verbal blazon, this is not
  essential. Without its fiery surroundings it would cease to be a
  ph&oelig;nix. On the other hand, though it is always depicted as a
  <i>demi</i><span class="nw">-bird</span> (no instance to the contrary
  exists), it is never considered necessary to so specify it. It occurs as
  the crest of the Seymour family ["Out of a ducal coronet a ph&oelig;nix
  issuant from flames of fire"].</p>

  eagle. It is however seldom met with, though it figures in the crests of
  Roche (Lord Fermoy) and Trist. The osprey is sometimes known as the
  sea-eagle, and heraldically so termed.</p>

  <p><i>The Vulture</i> (probably from its repulsive appearance in nature
  and its equally repulsive habits) is not a heraldic favourite. Two of
  these birds occur, however, as the supporters of Lord Graves.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    461.</span>&mdash;Falcon.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Falcon</i> (Fig. 461) naturally falls next to the eagle for
  consideration. Considering the very important part this bird played in
  the social life of earlier centuries, this cannot be a matter of any
  surprise. Heraldry, in its emblazonment, makes no distinction between the
  appearance of the hawk and the falcon, but for canting and other reasons
  the bird will be found described by all its different names, <i>e.g.</i>
  in the arms of Hobson, to preserve the obvious pun, the two birds are
  blazoned as hobbies.</p>

  <p>The falcon is frequently (more often than not) found belled. With the
  slovenliness (or some may exalt it into the virtue of freedom from
  irritating restriction) characteristic of many matters in heraldic
  blazon, the simple term "belled" is found used indiscriminately to
  signify that the falcon is belled on one leg or belled on both, and if it
  is belled the bell must of necessity be on a jess. Others state that
  every falcon must of necessity (whether so blazoned or not) be belled
  upon at least one leg, and that when the term "belled" is used it
  signifies that it is belled upon both legs. There is still yet another
  alternative, viz. that when "belled" it has the bell on only one leg, but
  that when "jessed and belled" it is belled on both legs. The jess is the
  leather thong with which the bells are attached to the leg, and it is
  generally considered, and this may be accepted, that when the term
  "jessed" is included in the wording of the blazon the jesses are
  represented with the ends flying loose, unless the use of the term is
  necessitated by the jesses being of a different colour. When the term
  "vervelled" is also employed it signifies that the jesses have small
  rings attached to the floating ends. In actual practice, however, it
  should be remembered that if the bells and jesses are of a different
  colour, the use of the terms "jessed" and "belled" is essential. A falcon
  is seldom drawn without at least one bell, and when it is found described
  as "belled," in most cases it will be found that the intention is that it
  shall have two bells.</p>

  <p>Like all other birds of prey the falcon may be "armed," a technical
  term which theoretically should include the beak and legs, but in actual
  <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum" title="278.png"><a
  name="page242"></a>{242}</span>practice a falcon will be far more usually
  found described as "beaked and legged" when these differ in tincture from
  its plumage.</p>

  <p>When a falcon is blindfolded it is termed "hooded." It was always so
  carried on the wrist until it was flown.</p>

  <p>The position of the wings and the confusion in the terms applied
  thereto is even more marked in the case of the falcon than the eagle.</p>

  <p>Demi-falcons are not very frequently met with, but an example occurs
  in the crest of Jerningham.</p>

  <p>A falcon's head is constantly met with as a crest.</p>

  <p>When a falcon is represented preying upon anything it is termed
  "trussing" its prey, though sometimes the description "preying upon" is
  (perhaps less accurately) employed. Examples of this will be found in the
  arms of Madden ["Sable, a hawk or, trussing a mallard proper, on a chief
  of the second a cross botonny gules"], and in the crests of Graham,
  Cawston, and Yerburgh.</p>

  <p>A falcon's leg appears in the crest of Joscelin.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>The Pelican</i>, with its curious heraldic representation and its
  strange terms, may almost be considered an instance of the application of
  the existing name of a bird to an entirely fanciful creation. Mr. G. W.
  Eve, in his "Decorative Heraldry," states that in early representations
  of the bird it was depicted in a more naturalistic form, but I confess I
  have not myself met with such an ancient representation.</p>

  <p>Heraldically, it has been practically always depicted with the head
  and body of an eagle, with wings elevated and with the neck embowed,
  pecking with its beak at its breast. The term for this is "vulning
  itself," and although it appears to be necessary always to describe it in
  the blazon as "vulning itself," it will never be met with save in this
  position; a pelican's head even, when erased at the neck, being always so
  represented. It is supposed to be pecking at its breast to provide drops
  of blood as nourishment for its young, and it is termed "in its piety"
  when depicted standing in its nest and with its brood of young (Fig.
  462). It is difficult to imagine how the pelican came to be considered as
  always existing in this position, because there is nothing in the nature
  of a natural habit from which this could be derived. There are, however,
  other birds which, during the brooding season, lose their feathers upon
  the breast, and some which grow red feathers there, and it is doubtless
  from this that the idea originated.</p>

  <p>In heraldic and ecclesiastical symbolism the pelican has acquired a
  somewhat sacred character as typical of maternal solicitude. It <!-- Page
  243 --><span class="pagenum" title="279.png"><a
  name="page243"></a>{243}</span>will never be found "close," or in any
  other positions than with the wings endorsed and either elevated or
  inverted.</p>

  <p>When blazoned "proper," it is always given the colour and plumage of
  the eagle, and not its natural colour of white. In recent years, however,
  a tendency has rather made itself manifest to give the pelican its
  natural and more ungainly appearance, and its curious pouched beak.</p>

  <p><i>The Ostrich</i> (Fig. 463) is doubtless the bird which is most
  frequently met with as a crest after the falcon, unless it be the dove or
  martlet. The ostrich is heraldically emblazoned in a very natural manner,
  and it is difficult to understand why in the case of such a bird heraldic
  artists of earlier days should have remained so true to the natural form
  of the bird, whilst in other cases, in which they could have had no less
  intimate acquaintance with the bird, greater variation is to be
  found.</p>

  <p>As a charge upon a shield it is not very common, although instances
  are to be found in the arms of MacMahon ["Argent, an ostrich sable, in
  its beak a horse-shoe or"], and in the arms of Mahon ["Per fess sable and
  argent, an ostrich counterchanged, holding in its beak a horse-shoe
  or"].</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig463.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig463.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    463.</span>&mdash;Ostrich.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is curious that, until quite recent times, the ostrich is never met
  with heraldically, unless holding a horse-shoe, a key, or some other
  piece of old iron in its beak. The digestive capacity of the ostrich,
  though somewhat exaggerated, is by no means fabulous, and in the earliest
  forms of its representation in all the old natural history books it is
  depicted feeding upon this unnatural food. If this were the popular idea
  of the bird, small wonder is it that heraldic artists perpetuated the
  idea, and even now the heraldic ostrich is seldom seen without a key or a
  horse-shoe in its beak.</p>

  <p>The ostrich's head alone is sometimes met with, as in the crest of the
  Earl of Carysfort.</p>

  <p>The wing of an ostrich charged with a bend sable is the crest of a
  family of Gulston, but an ostrich wing is by no means a usual heraldic
  charge.</p>

  <p>Ostrich feathers, of course, play a large part in armory, but the
  consideration of these may be postponed for the moment until the feathers
  of cocks and peacocks can be added thereto.</p>

  <p><i>The Dove</i>&mdash;at least the heraldic bird&mdash;has one curious
  peculiarity. It is always represented with a slight tuft on its head. Mr.
  Eve considers this to be merely the perpetuation of some case in which
  the crude draughtsman has added a tuft to its head. Possibly he is <!--
  Page 244 --><span class="pagenum" title="280.png"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>correct, but I think it may be an attempt
  to distinguish between the domestic dove and the wood-pigeon&mdash;both
  of which varieties would be known to the early heraldic artists.</p>

  <p>The dove with an olive branch in its beak is constantly and
  continually met with. When blazoned "proper" it is quite correct to make
  the legs and feet of the natural pinky colour, but it will be more
  usually found that a dove is specifically described as "legged
  gules."</p>

  <p>The ordinary heraldic dove will be found most frequently represented
  with its wings close and holding a branch of laurel in its beak, but it
  also occurs volant and with outstretched wings. It is then frequently
  termed a "dove rising."</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig464.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig464.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    464.</span>&mdash;Dove.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The doves in the arms of the College of Arms are always represented
  with the sinister wing close, and the dexter wing extended and inverted.
  This has given rise to much curious speculation; but whatever may be the
  reason of the curious position of the wings, there can be very little
  doubt that the coat of arms itself is based upon the coat of St. Edward
  the Confessor. The so-called coat of St. Edward the Confessor is a cross
  patonce between five martlets, but it is pretty generally agreed that
  these martlets are a corruption of the doves which figure upon his coins,
  and one of which surmounts the sceptre which is known as St. Edward's
  staff, or "the sceptre with the dove."</p>

  <p><i>The Wood-Pigeon</i> is not often met with, but it does occur, as in
  the crest of the arms of Bradbury ["On a wreath of the colours, in front
  of a demi-wood-pigeon, wings displayed and elevated argent, each wing
  charged with a round buckle tongue pendent sable, and holding in the beak
  a sprig of barberry, the trunk of a tree fesswise eradicated, and
  sprouting to the dexter, both proper "].</p>

      <a href="images/fig465.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig465.png"
      alt="Fig. 465." title="Fig. 465." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    465.</span>&mdash;Martlet.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Martlet</i> is another example of the curious perpetuation in
  heraldry of the popular errors of natural history. Even at the present
  day, in many parts of the country, it is popularly believed that a
  swallow has no feet, or, at any rate, cannot perch upon the ground, or
  raise itself therefrom. The fact that one never does see a swallow upon
  the ground supports the foundation of the idea. At any rate the heraldic
  swallow, which is known as the martlet, is never represented with feet,
  the legs terminating in the feathers which cover the upper parts of the
  leg (Fig. 465). It is curious that the same idea is perpetuated in the
  little legend of the explanation, which may or may <!-- Page 245 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="281.png"><a name="page245"></a>{245}</span>not be
  wholly untrue, that the reason the martlet has been adopted as the mark
  of cadency for the fourth son is to typify the fact that whilst the
  eldest son succeeds to his father's lands, and whilst the second son may
  succeed, perhaps, to the mother's, there can be very little doubt that by
  the time the fourth son is reached, there is no land remaining upon which
  he can settle, and that he must, perforce, fly away from the homestead to
  gather him means elsewhere. At any rate, whether this be true or false,
  the martlet certainly is never represented in heraldry with feet. If the
  feet are shown, the bird becomes a swallow.</p>

  <p>Most heraldry books state also that the martlet has no beak. How such
  an idea originated I am at a loss to understand, because I have never yet
  come across an official instance in which the martlet is so depicted.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig466.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig466.png"
      alt="Fig. 466." title="Fig. 466." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    466.</span>&mdash;Martlet volant.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Perhaps the confusion between the foreign merlette&mdash;which is
  drawn like a duck without wings, feet, or forked tail&mdash;and the
  martlet may account for the idea that the martlet should be depicted
  without a beak.</p>

  <p>It is very seldom that the martlet occurs except close, and
  consequently it is never so specified in blazon. An instance, however, in
  which it occurs "rising" will be found in the crest of a family of Smith,
  and there are a number of instances in which it is volant (Fig. 466).</p>

  <p><i>The Swallow</i>, as distinct from the martlet, is sometimes met
  with.</p>

  <p>A swallow "volant" appears upon the arms usually ascribed to the town
  of Arundel. These, however, are not recorded as arms in the Visitation
  books, the design being merely noted as a seal device, and one hesitates
  to assert definitely what the status of the design in question may be.
  The pun upon "l'hirondelle" was too good for ancient heralds to pass
  by.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    467.</span>&mdash;Swan.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Swan</i> (Fig. 467) is a very favourite charge, and will be
  found both as a crest and as a charge upon a shield, and in all varieties
  of position. It is usually, however, when appearing as a charge, to be
  found "close." A swan couchant appears as the crest of Barttelot, a swan
  regardant as the crest of Swaby, and a swan "rising" will be found as a
  crest of Guise and as a charge upon the arms of Muntz. Swimming in water
  it occurs in the crest of Stilwell, and a swan to which the unusual term
  of "rousant" is sometimes applied figures as <!-- Page 246 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="282.png"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>the
  crest of Stafford: "Out of a ducal coronet per pale gules and sable, a
  demi-swan rousant, wings elevated and displayed argent, beaked gules." It
  is, however, more usually blazoned as: "A demi-swan issuant (from the
  coronet, per pale gules and sable").</p>

  <p>Swans' heads and necks are not often met with as a charge, though they
  occur in the arms of Baker. As a crest they are very common, and will be
  found in the cases of Lindsay and Bates.</p>

  <p><i>The Duck</i>&mdash;with its varieties of the moorhen and
  eider-duck&mdash;is sometimes met with, and appears in the arms of
  Duckworth and Billiat. Few better canting examples can be found than the
  latter coat, in which the duck is holding the billet in its bill.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig468.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig468.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    468.</span>&mdash;Cock.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The other domestic bird&mdash;the <i>Cock</i>&mdash;is often met with,
  though it more often figures as a crest than upon a shield. A cock
  "proper" is generally represented of the kind which in farmyard
  phraseology is known as a gamecock (Fig. 468). Nevertheless the
  gamecock&mdash;as such&mdash;does occur; though in these cases, when so
  blazoned, it is usually depicted in the artificial form&mdash;deprived of
  its comb and wattles, as was the case when it was prepared for
  cock-fighting. Birds of this class are usually met with, with a comb and
  wattles, &amp;c., of a different colour, and are then termed "combed (or
  crested), wattled, and jelopped"&mdash;if it is desired to be strictly
  accurate&mdash;though it will be generally found that the term is dropped
  to "combed and jelopped." If the bird is termed "armed," the beak and
  spurs are thereby referred to. It occurs in the arms of Handcock (Lord
  Castlemaine) ["Ermine, on a chief sable, a dexter hand between two cocks
  argent"] and in the arms of Cokayne ["Argent, three cocks gules, armed,
  crested, and jelopped sable"], and also in that of Law. It likewise
  occurs in the arms of Aitken.</p>

  <p><i>The Sheldrake</i> appears occasionally under another name,
  <i>i.e.</i> that of the <i>Shoveller</i>, and as such will be found in
  the arms of Jackson, of Doncaster.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    469.</span>&mdash;Peacock in his pride.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The gorgeous plumage of the <i>Peacock</i> has of course resulted in
  its frequent employment. It has a special term of its own, being stated
  to be "in his pride" when shown affronté, and with the tail displayed
  (Fig. 469). It is seldom met with except in this position, though the
  well-known crest of Harcourt is an example to the contrary, as is the
  crest of Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, Bart., viz. "A mount vert, thereon <!--
  Page 247 --><span class="pagenum" title="283.png"><a
  name="page247"></a>{247}</span>a peacock amidst wheat, and in the beak an
  ear of wheat all proper." With the tail closed it also figures as one of
  the supporters of Sir Robert Hart, Bart. ["Sinister, a peacock close
  proper"]: its only appearance in such a position that I am aware of.</p>

  <p>A peacock's tail is not a familiar figure in British armory, though
  the exact contrary is the case in German practices. "Issuant from the
  mouth of a boar's head erect" it occurs as the crest of Tyrell, and "A
  plume of peacock's feathers"&mdash;which perhaps is the same
  thing&mdash;"issuant from the side of a chapeau" is the crest of Lord
  Sefton.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    470.</span>&mdash;Crane in its vigilance.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another bird for which heraldry has created a term of its own is the
  <i>Crane</i>. It is seldom met with except holding a stone in its claw,
  the term for which stone is its "vigilance," a curious old fable, which
  explains the whole matter, being that the crane held the stone in its
  foot so that if by any chance it fell asleep, the stone, by dropping,
  would awaken it, and thus act as its "vigilance" (Fig. 470). It is a pity
  that the truth of such a charming example of the old world should be
  dissipated by the fact that the crest of Cranstoun is the crane
  <i>asleep</i>&mdash;or rather dormant&mdash;with its head under its wing,
  and nevertheless holding its "vigilance" in its foot! The crane is not
  often met with, but it occurs in the arms of Cranstoun, with the curious
  and rather perplexing motto, "Thou shalt want ere I want." Before leaving
  the crane, it may be of interest to observe that the derivation of the
  word "pedigree" is from <i>pied de grue</i>, the appearance of a crane's
  foot and the branching lines indicative of issue being similar in
  shape.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    471.</span>&mdash;Stork holding in its beak a snake.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Heraldic representation makes little if any difference when depicting
  a crane, a stork, or a heron, except that the tuft on the head of the
  latter is never omitted when a heron is intended.</p>

  <p>Instances of the <i>Stork</i> are of fairly frequent occurrence, the
  usual heraldic method of depicting the bird being with the wings
  close.</p>

  <p>More often than not the stork is met with a snake in its beak (Fig.
  471); and the fact that a heron is also generally provided with an eel to
  play with adds to the confusion.</p>

  <p><i>The Heron</i>&mdash;or, as it was anciently more frequently termed
  heraldically, the <i>Herne</i> (Fig. 472)&mdash;will naturally be found
  in the arms of Hearne and some number of other coats and crests. <!--
  Page 248 --><span class="pagenum" title="284.png"><a
  name="page248"></a>{248}</span></p>

  <p><i>The Raven</i> (Fig. 473) occurs almost as early as any other
  heraldic bird. It is said to have been a Danish device. The powerful
  Norman family of Corbet, one of the few remaining families which can show
  an unbroken male descent from the time of the Conquest to the present
  day, have always remained faithful to the raven, though they have added
  to it sometimes a <i>bordure</i> or additional numbers of its kind. "Or,
  a raven sable," the well-known Corbet coat, is, of course, a canting
  allusion to their Norman name, or nickname, "Le Corbeau." Their name,
  like their pedigree, is unique, inasmuch as it is one of the few names of
  undoubted Norman origin which are not territorial, and possibly the fact
  that their lands of Moreton Corbett, one of their chief seats, were known
  by their name has assisted in the perpetuation of what was, originally,
  undoubtedly a personal nickname.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Fig. 474 is a striking example of the virility which can be imparted
  to the raven. It is reproduced from Grünenberg's "Book of Arms" (1483).
  Ströhl suggests it may be of "Corbie" in Picardy, but the identity of the
  arms leads one to fancy the name attached may be a misdescription of the
  English family of Corbet.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 474.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Heraldically, no difference is made in depicting the raven, the rook,
  and the crow; and examples of the Crow will be found in the arms of
  Crawhall, and of the <i>Rook</i> in the crest of Abraham. The arms of the
  Yorkshire family of Creyke are always blazoned as rooks, but I am
  inclined to think they may possibly have been originally <i>creykes</i>,
  or corn-crakes.</p>

  <p><i>The Cornish Chough</i> is very much more frequently met with than
  either the crow, rook, or raven, and it occurs in the arms of Bewley, the
  town of Canterbury, and (as a crest) of Cornwall.</p>

  <p>It can only be distinguished from the raven in heraldic
  representations by the fact that the Cornish chough is always depicted
  and frequently blazoned as "beaked and legged gules," as it is found in
  its natural state. <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum" title="285.png"
  ><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span></p>

  <p><i>The Owl</i> (Fig. 475), too, is a very favourite bird. It is always
  depicted with the face affronté, though the body is not usually so
  placed. It occurs in the arms of Leeds&mdash;which, by the way, are an
  example of colour upon colour&mdash;Oldham, and Dewsbury. In the crest of
  Brimacombe the wings are open, a most unusual position.</p>

  <p><i>The Lark</i> will be found in many cases of arms or crests for
  families of the name of Clarke.</p>

  <p><i>The Parrot</i>, or, as it is more frequently termed heraldically,
  the <i>Popinjay</i> (Fig. 476), will be found in the arms of Lumley and
  other families. It also occurs in the arms of Curzon: "Argent, on a bend
  sable three popinjays or, collared gules."</p>

  <p>There is nothing about the bird, or its representations, which needs
  special remark, and its usual heraldic form follows nature pretty
  closely.</p>

  <p><i>The Moorcock</i> or <i>Heathcock</i> is curious, inasmuch as there
  are two distinct forms in which it is depicted. Neither of them are
  correct from the natural point of view, and they seem to be pretty well
  interchangeable from the heraldic point of view. The bird is always
  represented with the head and body of an ordinary cock, but sometimes it
  is given the wide flat tail of black game, and sometimes a curious tail
  of two or more erect feathers at right angles to its body (Fig. 477).</p>

  <p>Though usually represented close, it occurs sometimes with open wings,
  as in the crest of a certain family of Moore.</p>

  <p>Many other birds are to be met with in heraldry, but they have nothing
  at all especial in their bearing, and no special rules govern them.</p>

  <p><i>The Lapwing</i>, under its alternative names of <i>Peewhit</i>,
  <i>Plover</i>, and <i>Tyrwhitt</i>, will be found in the arms of Downes,
  Tyrwhitt, and Tweedy.</p>

  <p><i>The Pheasant</i> will be found in the crest of Scott-Gatty, and the
  <i>Kingfisher</i> in many cases of arms of the name of Fisher. <!-- Page

  <p><i>The Magpie</i> occurs in the arms of Dusgate, and in those of
  Finch.</p>

  <p>Woodward mentions an instance in which the <i>Bird of Paradise</i>
  occurs (p. 267); "Argent, on a terrace vert, a cannon mounted or,
  supporting a Bird of Paradise proper" [Rjevski and Yeropkin]; and the
  arms of Thornton show upon a canton the Swedish bird <i>tjader</i>:
  "Ermine, a chevron sable between three hawthorn trees eradicated proper,
  a canton or, thereon the Swedish bird tjader, or cock of the wood, also
  proper." Two similar birds were granted to the first Sir Edward Thornton,
  G.C.B., as supporters, he being a Knight Grand Cross.</p>

    "Shield for Peace" of Edward the Black Prince (<i>d.</i> 1376): Sable,
    three ostrich feathers with scrolls argent. (From his tomb in
    Canterbury Cathedral.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Single feathers as charges upon a shield are sometimes met with, as in
  the "shield for peace" of Edward the Black Prince (Fig. 478) and in the
  arms of Clarendon. These two examples are, however, derivatives from the
  historic ostrich-feather badges of the English Royal Family, and will be
  more conveniently dealt with later when considering the subject of
  badges. The single feather enfiled by the circlet of crosses patée and
  fleurs-de-lis, which is borne upon a canton of augmentation upon the arms
  of Gull, Bart., is likewise a derivative, but feathers as a charge occur
  in the arms of Jervis: "Argent, six ostrich feathers, three, two, and one
  sable." A modern coat founded upon this, in which the ostrich feathers
  are placed upon a pile, between two bombshells fracted in base, belongs
  to a family of a very similar name, and the crest granted therewith is a
  single ostrich feather between two bombs fired. Cock's feathers occur as
  charges in the arms of Galpin.</p>

  <p>In relation to the crest, feathers are constantly to be found, which
  is not to be wondered at, inasmuch as fighting and tournament helmets,
  when actually in use, frequently did not carry the actual crests of the
  owners, but were simply adorned with the plume of ostrich feathers. A
  curious instance of this will be found in the case of the family of
  Dymoke of Scrivelsby, the Honourable the King's Champions. The crest is
  really: "Upon a wreath of the colours, the two ears of an ass sable,"
  though other crests ["1. a sword erect proper; 2. a lion as in the arms"]
  are sometimes made use of. When the Champion performs his service at a
  Coronation the shield which is carried by his esquire is not that of his
  sovereign, but is emblazoned with his personal arms of Dymoke: "Sable,
  two lions passant in pale argent, ducally crowned or." The helmet of the
  Champion is decorated with a triple plume of ostrich feathers and not
  with the Dymoke crest. In <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum" title="287.png"

  warfare the helmet will far oftener be found simply adorned with a plume
  of ostrich feathers than with a heritable crest, and consequently such a
  plume has remained in use as the crest of a very large number of
  families. This point is, however, more fully dealt with in the chapter
  upon crests.</p>

  <p>The plume of ostrich feathers is, moreover, attributed as a crest to a
  far greater number of families than it really belongs to, because if a
  family possessed no crest the helmet was generally ornamented with a
  plume of ostrich feathers, which later generations have accepted and
  adopted as their heritable crest, when it never possessed such a
  character. A notable instance of this will be found in the crest of
  Astley, as given in the Peerage Books.</p>

  <p>The number of feathers in a plume requires to be stated; it will
  usually be found to be three, five, or seven, though sometimes a larger
  number are met with. When it is termed a double plume they are arranged
  in two rows, the one issuing above the other, and a triple plume is
  arranged in three rows; and though it is correct to speak of any number
  of feathers as a plume, it will usually be found that the word is
  reserved for five or more, whilst a plume of three feathers would more
  frequently be termed three ostrich feathers. Whilst they are usually
  white, they are also found of varied colours, and there is even an
  instance to be met with of ostrich feathers of ermine. When the feathers
  are of different colours they need to be carefully blazoned; if
  alternately, it is enough to use the word "alternately," the feather at
  the extreme dexter side being depicted of the colour first mentioned. In
  a plume which is of three colours, care must be used in noting the
  arrangement of the colours, the colours first mentioned being that of the
  dexter feather; the others then follow from dexter to sinister, the
  fourth feather commencing the series of colours again. If any other
  arrangement of the colours occurs it must be specifically detailed. The
  rainbow-hued plume from which the crest of Sir Reginald Barnewall<a
  name="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> issues is the most
  variegated instance I have met with.</p>

  <p>Two peacock's feathers in saltire will be found in the crest of a
  family of Gatehouse, and also occur in the crest of
  Crisp-Molineux-Montgomerie. The pen in heraldry is always of course of
  the quill variety, and consequently should not be mistaken for a single
  feather. The term "penned" is used when the quill of a feather is of a
  different colour from the remainder of it. Ostrich and other feathers are
  very frequently found on either side of a crest, both in British and
  Continental armory; but though often met with in this position, there is
  nothing peculiar about this use in such character. German heraldry <!--
  Page 252 --><span class="pagenum" title="288.png"><a
  name="page252"></a>{252}</span>has evolved one use of the peacock's
  feather, or rather for the eye from the peacock's feather, which happily
  has not yet reached this country. It will be found adorning the outer
  edges of every kind of object, and it even occurs on occasion as a kind
  of dorsal fin down the back of animals. Bunches of cock's feathers are
  also frequently made use of for the same purpose. There has been
  considerable diversity in the method of depicting the ostrich feather. In
  its earliest form it was stiff and erect as if cut from a piece of board
  (Fig. 478), but gradually, as the realistic type of heraldic art came
  into vogue, it was represented more naturally and with flowing and
  drooping curves. Of later years, however, we have followed the example of
  His Majesty when Prince of Wales and reverted to the earlier form, and it
  is now very general to give to the ostrich feather the stiff and straight
  appearance which it originally possessed when heraldically depicted.
  Occasionally a plume of ostrich feathers is found enclosed in a "case,"
  that is, wrapped about the lower part as if it were a bouquet, and this
  form is the more usual in Germany. In German heraldry these plumes are
  constantly met with in the colours of the arms, or charged with the whole
  or a part of the device upon the shield. It is not a common practice in
  this country, but an instance of it will be found in the arms of Lord
  Waldegrave: "Per pale argent and gules. Crest: out of a ducal coronet or
  a plume of five ostrich feathers, the first two argent, the third per
  pale argent and gules, and the last two gules." <!-- Page 253 --><span

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XV</h5>

<h5>FISH</h5>

  <p>Heraldry has a system of "natural" history all its very own, and
  included in the comprehensive heraldic term of fish are dolphins, whales,
  and other creatures. There are certain terms which apply to heraldic fish
  which should be noted. A fish in a horizontal position is termed
  "naiant," whether it is in or upon water or merely depicted as a charge
  upon a shield. A fish is termed "hauriant" if it is in a perpendicular
  position, but though it will usually be represented with the head upwards
  in default of any specific direction to the contrary, it by no means
  follows that this is always the case, and it is more correct to state
  whether the head is upwards or downwards, a practice which it is usually
  found will be conformed to. When the charges upon a shield are simply
  blazoned as "fish," no particular care need be taken to represent any
  particular variety, but on the other hand it is not in such cases usual
  to add any distinctive signs by which a charge which is merely a fish
  might become identified as any particular kind of fish.</p>

  <p>The heraldic representations of the <i>Dolphin</i> are strangely
  dissimilar from the real creature, and also show amongst themselves a
  wide variety and latitude. It is early found in heraldry, and no doubt
  its great importance in that science is derived from its usage by the
  Dauphins of France. Concerning its use by these Princes there are all
  sorts of curious legends told, the most usual being that recited by
  Berry.</p>

  <p>Woodward refers to this legend, but states that "in 1343 King Philip
  of France <i>purchased</i> the domains of Humbert III., Dauphin de
  Viennois," and further remarks that the legend in question "seems to be
  without solid foundation." But neither Woodward nor any other writer
  seems to have previously suggested what is doubtless the true
  explanation, that the title of Dauphin and the province of Viennois were
  a separate dignity of a sovereign character, to which were attached
  certain territorial and sovereign arms ["Or, a dolphin embowed azure,
  finned and langued gules"]. The assumption of these sovereign arms with
  the sovereignty and territory to which they belonged, was as much a
  matter of course as the use of separate arms for the Duchy of Lancaster
  <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum" title="290.png"><a
  name="page254"></a>{254}</span>by his present Majesty King Edward VII.,
  or the use of separate arms for his Duchy of Cornwall by H.R.H. the
  Prince of Wales.</p>

  <p>Berry is wrong in asserting that no other family were permitted to
  display the dolphin in France, because a very similar coat (but with the
  dolphin lifeless) to that of the Dauphin was quartered by the family of
  La Tour du Pin, who claimed descent from the Dauphins d'Auvergne, another
  ancient House which originally bore the sovereign title of Dauphin. A
  dolphin was the charge upon the arms of the Grauff von Dälffin (Fig.
  481).</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig479.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig479.png"
      alt="Fig. 479." title="Fig. 479." /></a>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    480.</span>&mdash;Dolphin hauriant.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The dolphin upon this shield, as also that in the coat of the Dauphin
  of France, is neither naiant nor hauriant, but is "embowed," that is,
  with the tail curved towards the head. But the term "embowed" really
  signifies nothing further than "bent" in some way, and as a dolphin is
  never heraldically depicted straight, it is always understood to be and
  usually is termed "embowed," though it will generally be "naiant embowed"
  (Fig. 479), or "hauriant embowed" (Fig. 480). The dolphin occurs in the
  arms of many British families, <i>e.g.</i> in the arms of Ellis,
  Monypenny, Loder-Symonds, Symonds-Taylor, Fletcher, and
  Stuart-French.</p>

  <p>Woodward states that the dolphin is used as a supporter by the
  Trevelyans, Burnabys, &amp;c. In this statement he is clearly incorrect,
  for neither of those families are entitled to or use supporters. But his
  statement probably originates in the practice which in accordance with
  the debased ideas of artistic decoration at one period added all sorts of
  fantastic objects to the edges of a shield for purely decorative (!)
  purposes. The only instance within my knowledge in which a dolphin
  figures as a heraldic supporter will be found in the case of the arms of
  Waterford.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:18%;">

  </div>

  <p><i>The Whale</i> is seldom met with in British armory, one of its few
  appearances being in the arms of Whalley, viz.: "Argent, three whales'
  heads erased sable." <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum" title="291.png"
  ><a name="page255"></a>{255}</span></p>

  <p>The crest of an Irish family named Yeates is said to be: "A shark
  issuant regardant swallowing a man all proper," and the same device is
  also attributed to some number of other families.</p>

  <p>Another curious piscine coat of arms is that borne, but still
  unmatriculated, by the burgh of Inveraray, namely: "The field is the sea
  proper, a net argent suspended to the base from the dexter chief and the
  sinister fess points, and in chief two and in base three herrings
  entangled in the net."</p>

  <p><i>Salmon</i> are not infrequently met with, but they need no specific
  description. They occur in the arms of Peebles,<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> a coat of arms which in an alternative
  blazon introduces to one's notice the term "contra-naiant." The
  explanation of the quaint and happy conceit of these arms and motto is
  that for every fish which goes up the river to spawn two return to the
  sea. A salmon on its back figures in the arms of the city of Glasgow, and
  also in the arms of Lumsden and Finlay, whilst other instances of salmon
  occur in the arms of Blackett-Ord, Sprot, and Winlaw.</p>

  <p><i>The Herring</i> occurs in the arms of Maconochie, the <i>Roach</i>
  in the arms of Roche ["Gules, three roaches naiant within a bordure
  engrailed argent. Crest: a rock, thereon a stork close, charged on the
  breast with a torteau, and holding in his dexter claw a roach proper"],
  and <i>Trout</i> in the arms of Troutbeck ["Azure, three trout fretted
  tête à la queue argent"]. The same arrangement of three fish occurs upon
  the seal of Anstruther Wester, but this design unfortunately has never
  been matriculated as a coat of arms.</p>

  <p>The arms of Iceland present a curious charge, which is included upon
  the Royal shield of Denmark. The coat in question is: "Gules, a stockfish
  argent, crowned with an open crown or." The stockfish is a dried and
  cured cod, split open and with the head removed.</p>

  <p><i>A Pike</i> or <i>Jack</i> is more often termed a "lucy" in English
  heraldry and a "ged" in Scottish. Under its various names it occurs in
  the arms of Lucy, Lucas, Geddes, and Pyke.</p>

  <p><i>The Eel</i> is sometimes met with, as in the arms of Ellis, and
  though, as Woodward states, it is always given a wavy form, the term
  "ondoyant," which he uses to express this, has, I believe, no place in an
  English armorist's dictionary.</p>

  <p><i>The Lobster</i> and <i>Crab</i> are not unknown to English armory,
  being respectively the crests of the families of Dykes and Bridger. The
  arms of Bridger are: "Argent, a chevron engrailed sable, between three
  crabs gules." Lobster claws are a charge upon the arms of Platt-Higgins.

  <p>The arms of Birt are given in Papworth as: "Azure, a birthfish
  proper," and of Bersich as: "Argent, a perch azure." The arms of Cobbe
  (Bart., extinct) are: "Per chevron gules and sable, in chief two swans
  respecting and in base a herring cob naiant proper." The arms of Bishop
  Robinson of Carlisle were: "Azure, a flying fish in bend argent, on a
  chief of the second, a rose gules between two torteaux," and the crest of
  Sir Philip Oakley Fysh is: "On a wreath of the colours, issuant from a
  wreath of red coral, a cubit arm vested azure, cuffed argent, holding in
  the hand a flying fish proper." The coat of arms of Colston of Essex is:
  "Azure, two barbels hauriant respecting each other argent," and a barbel
  occurs in the crest of Binney. "Vert, three sea-breams or hakes hauriant
  argent" is the coat of arms attributed to a family of Dox or Doxey, and
  "Or, three chabots gules" is that of a French family of the name of
  Chabot. "Barry wavy of six argent and gules, three crevices (crayfish)
  two and one or" is the coat of Atwater. Codfish occur in the arms of
  Beck, dogfish in the arms of Dodds (which may, however, be merely the
  sea-dog of the Dodge achievement), flounders or flukes in the arms of
  Arbutt, garvinfishes in the arms of Garvey, and gudgeon in the arms of
  Gobion. Papworth also includes instances of mackerel, prawns, shrimps,
  soles, sparlings, sturgeon, sea-urchins, turbots, whales, and whelks. The
  whelk shell (Fig. 482) appears in the arms of Storey and Wilkinson. <!--

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XVI</h5>

<h5>REPTILES</h5>

  <p>If armorial zoology is "shaky" in its classification of and dealings
  with fish, it is most wonderful when its laws and selections are
  considered under the heading of reptiles. But with the exception of
  serpents (of various kinds), the remainder must have no more than a
  passing mention.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig483.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig483.png"
      alt="Fig. 483." title="Fig. 483." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    483.</span>&mdash;Serpent nowed.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The usual heraldic <i>Serpent</i> is most frequently found "nowed,"
  that is, interlaced in a knot (Fig. 483). There is a certain
  well-understood form for the interlacing which is always officially
  adhered to, but of late there has manifested itself amongst heraldic
  artists a desire to break loose to a certain extent from the stereotyped
  form. A serpent will sometimes be found "erect" and occasionally gliding
  or "glissant," and sometimes it will be met with in a circle with its
  tail in its mouth&mdash;the ancient symbol of eternity. Its constant
  appearance in British armory is due to the fact that it is symbolically
  accepted as the sign of medicine, and many grants of arms made to doctors
  and physicians introduce in some way either the serpent or the rod of
  Æsculapius, or a serpent entwined round a staff. A serpent embowed biting
  its tail occurs in the arms of Falconer, and a serpent on its back in the
  crest of Backhouse. Save for the matter of position, the serpent of
  British armory is always drawn in a very naturalistic manner. It is
  otherwise, however, in Continental armory, where the serpent takes up a
  position closely allied to that of our dragon. It is even sometimes found
  winged, and the arms of the family of Visconti, which subsequently came
  into use as the arms of the Duchy of Milan (Fig. 484), have familiarised
  us as far as Continental armory is concerned with a form of serpent which
  is very different from the real animal or from our own heraldic variety.
  Another instance of a serpent will be found in the arms of the Irish
  family of Cotter, which are: "Argent, a chevron gules between three
  serpents proper," and the family of Lanigan O'Keefe bear in one <!-- Page
  258 --><span class="pagenum" title="294.png"><a
  name="page258"></a>{258}</span>quarter of their shield: "Vert, three
  lizards in pale or." The family of Cole bear: "Argent, a chevron gules
  between three scorpions reversed sable," a coat of arms which is
  sometimes quoted with the chevron and the scorpions both gules or both
  sable. The family of Preed of Shropshire bear: "Azure, three
  horse-leeches;" and the family of Whitby bear: "Gules, three snakes
  coiled or; on a chief of the second, as many pheons sable." A family of
  Sutton bears: "Or, a newt vert, in chief a lion rampant gules all within
  a bordure of the last," and Papworth mentions a coat of arms for the name
  of Ory: "Azure, a chameleon on a shady ground proper, in chief a sun or."
  Another coat mentioned by Papworth is the arms of Bume: "Gules, a
  stellion serpent proper," though what the creature may be it is
  impossible to imagine. Unfortunately, when one comes to examine so many
  of these curious coats of arms, one finds no evidence that such families
  existed, or that there is no official authority or record of the arms to
  which reference can be made. There can be no doubt that they largely
  consist of misreadings or misinterpretations of both names and charges,
  and I am sorely afraid this remark is the true explanation of what
  otherwise would be most strange and interesting curiosities of arms. Sir
  Walter Scott's little story in "Quentin Durward" of Toison d'Or, who
  depicted the "cat looking through the dairy window" as the arms of
  Childebert, and blazoned it "sable a musion passant or, oppressed with a
  trellis gules, cloué of the second," gives in very truth the real origin
  of many quaint coats of arms and heraldic terms. Ancient heraldic writers
  seem to have amused themselves by inventing "appropriate" arms for
  mythological or historical personages, and I verily believe that when so
  doing they never intended these arms to stand for more than examples of
  their own wit. Their credulous successors incorporated these little
  witticisms in the rolls of arms they collected, and one can only hope
  that in the distant future the charming drawings of Mr. E. T. Reed which
  in recent years have appeared in <i>Punch</i> may not be used in like
  manner.</p>

  <p>There are but few instances in English armory in which the <i>Toad</i>
  or <i>Frog</i> is met with. In fact, the only instance which one can
  recollect is the coat of arms attributed to a family of Botreaux, who are
  said to have borne: "Argent, three toads erect sable." I am confident,
  however, that this coat of arms, if it ever existed, and if it could be
  traced to its earliest sources, would be found to be really three buckets
  of water, a canting allusion to the name. Toads of course are the charges
  on the mythical arms of Pharamond.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Amongst the few instances I have come across of a snail in British
  armory are the crest of Slack of Derwent Hill ("in front of a crescent
  or, a snail proper") and the coat attributed by Papworth to the family of
  <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum" title="297.png"><a
  name="page259"></a>{259}</span>Bartan or Bertane, who are mentioned as
  bearing, "Gules, three snails argent in their shells or." This coat,
  however, is not matriculated in Scotland, so that one cannot be certain
  that it was ever borne. The snail occurs, however, as the crest of a
  family named Billers, and is also attributed to several other families as
  a crest.</p>

  <p><i>Lizards</i> appear occasionally in heraldry, though more frequently
  in Irish than English or Scottish coats of arms. A lizard forms part of
  the crest of Sillifant, and a hand grasping a lizard is the crest of
  M&lsquo;Carthy, and "Azure, three lizards or" the first quarter of the
  arms of an Irish family of the name of Cotter, who, however, blazon these
  charges upon their shield as evetts. The family of Enys, who bear:
  "Argent, three wyverns volant in pale vert," probably derive their arms
  from some such source. <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum" title="298.png"

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XVII</h5>

<h5>INSECTS</h5>

  <p>The insect which is most usually met with in heraldry is undoubtedly
  the <i>Bee</i>. Being considered, as it is, the symbol of industry, small
  wonder that it has been so frequently adopted. It is usually represented
  as if displayed upon the shield, and it is then termed volant, though of
  course the real term which will sometimes be found used is "volant <i>en
  arrière</i>" (Fig. 485). It occurs in the arms of Dore, Beatson,
  Abercromby, Samuel, and Sewell, either as a charge or as a crest. Its
  use, however, as a crest is slightly more varied, inasmuch as it is found
  walking in profile, and with its wings elevated, and also perched upon a
  thistle as in the arms of Ferguson. A bee-hive "with bees diversely
  volant" occurs in the arms of Rowe, and the popularity of the bee in
  British armory is doubtless due to the frequent desire to perpetuate the
  fact that the foundation of a house has been laid by business industry.
  The fact that the bee was adopted as a badge by the Emperor Napoleon gave
  it considerable importance in French armory, inasmuch as he assumed it
  for his own badge, and the mantle and pavilion around the armorial
  bearings of the Empire were semé of these insects. They also appeared
  upon his own coronation mantle. He adopted them under the impression,
  which may or may not be correct, that they had at one time been the badge
  of Childeric, father of Clovis. The whole story connected with their
  assumption by Napoleon has been a matter of much controversy, and little
  purpose would be served by going into the matter here, but it may be
  added that Napoleon changed the fleur-de-lis upon the chief in the arms
  of Paris to golden bees upon a chief of gules, and a chief azure, semé of
  bees or, was added as indicative of their rank to the arms of
  "Princes-Grand-Dignitaries of the Empire." A bee-hive occurs as the crest
  of a family named Gwatkin, and also upon the arms of the family of Kettle
  of Wolverhampton.</p>

<p><!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum" title="299.png"><a name="page261"></a>{261}</span></p>

  <p><i>The Grasshopper</i> is most familiar as the crest of the family of
  Gresham, and this is the origin of the golden grasshoppers which are so
  constantly met with in the city of London. "Argent, a chevron sable
  between three grasshoppers vert" is the coat of arms of Woodward of Kent.
  Two of them figure in the arms of Treacher, which arms are now quartered
  by Bowles.</p>

  <p><i>Ants</i> are but seldom met with. "Argent, six ants, three, two,
  and one sable," is a coat given by Papworth to a family of the name of
  Tregent; "Vert, an ant argent," to Kendiffe; and "Argent, a chevron vert
  between three beetles proper" are the arms attributed by the same
  authority to a family named Muschamp. There can be little doubt, however,
  that these "beetles" should be described as flies.</p>

  <p><i>Butterflies</i> figure in the arms of Papillon ["Azure, a chevron
  between three butterflies volant argent"] and in the arms of Penhellicke
  ["Sable, three butterflies volant argent"].</p>

  <p><i>Gadflies</i> are to be found in a coat of arms for the name of
  Adams ["Per pale argent and gules, a chevron between three gadflies
  counterchanged"], and also in the arms of Somerscales, quartered by Skeet
  of Bishop Stortford. "Sable, a hornet argent" is one blazon for the arms
  of Bollord or Bolloure, but elsewhere the same coat is blazoned: "Sable,
  a harvest-fly in pale volant en arrière argent." Harvest flies were the
  charges on the arms of the late Sir Edward Watkin, Bart.</p>

  <p><i>Crickets</i> appear in the arms ["azure, a fire chest argent,
  flames proper, between three crickets or"] recently granted to Sir George
  Anderson Critchett, Bart.</p>

  <p>The arms of Bassano (really of foreign origin and not an English coat)
  are: "Per chevron vert and argent, in chief three silkworm flies palewise
  <i>en arrière</i>, and in base a mulberry branch all counterchanged."
  "Per pale gules and azure, three stag-beetles, wings extended or," is
  assigned by Papworth to the Cornish family of Dore, but elsewhere these
  charges (under the same family name) are quoted as bees, gadflies, and
  flies. "Or, three spiders azure" is quoted as a coat for Chettle. A
  spider also figures as a charge on the arms of Macara. The crest of
  Thorndyke of Great Carleton, Lincolnshire, is: "On a wreath of the
  colours a damask rose proper, leaves and thorns vert, at the bottom of
  the shield a beetle or scarabæus proper."</p>

  <p>Woodward, in concluding his chapter upon insects, quotes the arms of
  the family of Pullici of Verona, viz.: "Or, semé of fleas sable, two
  bends gules, surmounted by two bends sinister of the same." <!-- Page 262

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XVIII</h5>

<h5>TREES, LEAVES, FRUITS, AND FLOWERS</h5>

  <p>The vegetable kingdom plays an important part in heraldry. Trees will
  be found of all varieties and in all numbers, and though little
  difference is made in the appearance of many varieties when they are
  heraldically depicted, for canting purposes the various names are
  carefully preserved. When, however, no name is specified, they are
  generally drawn after the fashion of oak-trees.</p>

  <p>When a tree issues from the ground it will usually be blazoned
  "issuant from a mount vert," but when the roots are shown it is termed
  "eradicated."</p>

    oak-tree eradicated.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>A Hurst of Trees</i> figures both on the shield and in the crest of
  France-Hayhurst, and in the arms of Lord Lismore ["Argent, in base a
  mount vert, on the dexter side a hurst of oak-trees, therefrom issuing a
  wolf passant towards the sinister, all proper"]. A hurst of elm-trees
  very properly is the crest of the family of Elmhurst. Under the
  description of a forest, a number of trees figure in the arms of
  Forrest.</p>

  <p>The arms of Walkinshaw of that Ilk are: "Argent, a grove of fir-trees
  proper," and Walkinshaw of Barrowfield and Walkinshaw of London have
  matriculated more or less similar arms.</p>

  <p><i>The Oak-Tree</i> (Fig. 486) is of course the tree most frequently
  met with. Perhaps the most famous coat in which it occurs will be found
  in the arms granted to Colonel Carlos, to commemorate his risky sojourn
  with King Charles in the oak-tree at Boscobel, after the King's flight
  subsequent to the ill-fated battle of Worcester. The coat was: "Or, on a
  mount in base vert, an oak-tree proper, fructed or, surmounted by a fess
  gules, charged with three imperial crowns of the third" (Plate II.).</p>

  <p><i>Fir-Trees</i> will be found in the arms of Greg, Melles, De la
  Ferté, and Farquharson.</p>

  <p><i>A Cedar-Tree</i> occurs in the arms of Montefiore ["Argent, a
  cedar-tree, between two mounts of flowers proper, on a chief azure, a
  dagger <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum" title="301.png"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>erect proper, pommel and hilt or, between
  two mullets of six points gold"], and a <i>hawthorn-tree</i> in the arms
  of MacMurrogh-Murphy, Thornton, and in the crest of Kynnersley.</p>

  <p><i>A Maple-Tree</i> figures in the arms of Lord Mount-Stephen ["Or, on
  a mount vert, a maple-tree proper, in chief two fleurs-de-lis azure"],
  and in the crest of Lord Strathcona ["On a mount vert, a maple-tree, at
  the base thereof a beaver gnawing the trunk all proper"].</p>

  <p><i>A Cocoanut-Tree</i> is the principal charge in the arms of Glasgow
  (now Robertson-Glasgow) of Montgrennan, matriculated in 1807 ["Argent, a
  cocoanut-tree fructed proper, growing out of a mount in base vert, on a
  chief azure, a shakefork between a martlet on the dexter and a salmon on
  the sinister argent, the last holding in the mouth a ring or"].</p>

  <p>The arms of Clifford afford an instance of a <i>Coffee-Tree</i>, and
  the coat of Chambers has a negro cutting down a <i>Sugar-Cane</i>.</p>

  <p><i>A Palm-Tree</i> occurs in the arms of Besant and in the armorials
  of many other families. The crest of Grimké-Drayton affords an instance
  of the use of palmetto-trees. An <i>Olive-Tree</i> is the crest of
  Tancred, and a <i>Laurel-Tree</i> occurs in the crest of Somers.</p>

  <p><i>Cypress-Trees</i> are quoted by Papworth in the arms of Birkin,
  probably an error for birch-trees, but the cypress does occur in the arms
  of Tardy, Comte de Montravel ["Argent, three cypress-trees eradicated
  vert, on a chief gules, as many bezants"], and "Or, a willow (salix)
  proper" is the coat of the Counts de Salis (now Fane-de-Salis).</p>

  <p>The arms of Sweetland, granted in 1808, are: "Argent, on a mount vert,
  an orange-tree fructed proper, on a chief embattled gules, three roses of
  the field, barbed and seeded also proper."</p>

  <p><i>A Mountain-Ash</i> figures in the shield and crest of Wigan, and a
  <i>Walnut-Tree</i> is the crest of Waller, of Groombridge ["On a mount
  vert, a walnut-tree proper, on the sinister side an escutcheon pendent,
  charged with the arms of France, and thereupon a label of three points
  argent."]</p>

  <p>The arms of Arkwright afford an example of a <i>Cotton-Tree</i>.</p>

  <p>The curious crest of Sir John Leman, Lord Mayor of London, affords an
  instance of a <i>Lemon-Tree</i> ["In a lemon-tree proper, a pelican in
  her piety proper"].</p>

  <p>The arms of a family whose name appears to have been variously spelled
  Estwere, Estwrey, Estewer, Estower, and Esture, have: "Upon an argent
  field a tree proper," variously described as an apple-tree, an ash-tree,
  and a cherry-tree. The probabilities largely point to its being an
  ash-tree. "Or, on a mount in base vert, a pear-tree fructed proper" is
  the coat of arms of Pyrton or Peryton, and the arms granted in 1591 to
  Dr. Lopus, a physician to Queen Elizabeth, were: "Or, a <!-- Page 264
  --><span class="pagenum" title="302.png"><a
  name="page264"></a>{264}</span>pomegranate-tree eradicated vert, fructed
  gold, supported by a hart rampant proper, crowned and attired of the
  first."</p>

  <p><i>A Poplar Tree</i> occurs in the arms of Gandolfi, but probably the
  prime curiosity must be the coat of Abank, which Papworth gives as:
  "Argent, a China-cokar tree vert." Its botanical identity remains a
  mystery.</p>

  <p><i>Trunks of Trees</i> for some curious reason play a prominent part
  in heraldry. The arms of Borough, of Chetwynd Park, granted in 1702, are:
  "Argent, on a mount in base, in base the trunk of an oak-tree sprouting
  out two branches proper, with the shield of Pallas hanging thereon or,
  fastened by a belt gules," and the arms of Houldsworth (1868) of
  Gonaldston, co. Notts, are: "Ermine, the trunk of a tree in bend raguly
  eradicated at the base proper, between three foxes' heads, two in chief
  and one in base erased gules."</p>

  <p>But it is as a crest that this figure of the withered trunk sprouting
  again is most often met with, it being assigned to no less than
  forty-three families.</p>

  <p>In England again, by one of those curious fads by which certain
  objects were repeated over and over again in the wretched designs granted
  by the late Sir Albert Woods, Garter, in spite of their unsuitability,
  tree-trunks fesswise eradicated and sprouting are constantly met with
  either as the basis of the crest or placed "in front of it" to help in
  providing the differences and distinctions which he insisted upon in a
  new grant. An example of such use of it will be found in the arms of the
  town of Abergavenny.</p>

  <p><i>Stocks of Trees</i> "couped and eradicated" are by no means
  uncommon. They figure in the arms of the Borough of Woodstock: "Gules,
  the stump of a tree couped and eradicated argent, and in chief three
  stags' heads caboshed of the same, all within a bordure of the last
  charged with eight oak-leaves vert." They also occur in the arms of
  Grove, of Shenston Park, co. Stafford, and in the arms of Stubbs.</p>

  <p>The arms matriculated in Lyon Register by Capt. Peter Winchester
  (<i>c.</i> 1672-7) are: "Argent, a vine growing out of the base, leaved
  and fructed, between two papingoes endorsed feeding upon the clusters all
  proper." The vine also appears in the arms of Ruspoli, and the family of
  Archer-Houblon bear for the latter name: "Argent, on a mount in base,
  three hop-poles erect with hop-vines all proper."</p>

  <p>The town of St. Ives (Cornwall) has no authorised arms, but those
  usually attributed to the town are: "Argent, an ivy branch overspreading
  the whole field vert."</p>

  <p>"Gules, a flaming bush on the top of a mount proper, between three
  lions rampant argent, in the flanks two roses of the last" is the coat of
  Brander (now Dunbar-Brander) of Pitgavenny. Holly-bushes <!-- Page 265
  --><span class="pagenum" title="303.png"><a
  name="page265"></a>{265}</span>are also met with, as in the crests of
  Daubeney and Crackanthorpe, and a rose-bush as in the crest of
  Inverarity.</p>

  <p>The arms of Owen, co. Pembroke, are: "Gules, a boar argent, armed,
  bristled, collared, and chained or to a holly-bush on a mount in base
  both proper."</p>

  <p><i>A Fern-Brake</i> is another stock object used in designing modern
  crests, and will be found in the cases of Harter, Scott-Gatty, and
  Lloyd.</p>

  <p>Branches are constantly occurring, but they are usually oak, laurel,
  palm, or holly. They need to be distinguished from "slips," which are
  much smaller and with fewer leaves. Definite rules of distinction between
  e.g. an acorn "slipped," a slip of oak, and an oak-branch have been laid
  down by purists, but no such minute detail is officially observed, and it
  seems better to leave the point to general artistic discretion; the
  colloquial difference between a slip and a branch being quite a
  sufficient guide upon the point.</p>

  <p>An example of an <i>Oak-Branch</i> occurs in the arms of Aikman, and
  another, which is rather curious, is the crest of Accrington.<a
  name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Oak-Slips</i>, on the other hand, occur in the arms of Baldwin.</p>

  <p><i>A Palm-Branch</i> occurs in the crests of Innes, Chafy, and
  Corfield.</p>

  <p><i>Laurel-Branches</i> occur in the arms of Cooper, and sprigs of
  laurel in the arms of Meeking.</p>

  <p><i>Holly-Branches</i> are chiefly found in the arms of families named
  Irvine or Irwin, but they are invariably blazoned as "sheaves" of holly
  or as holly-branches of three leaves. To a certain extent this is a
  misnomer, because the so-called "branch" is merely three holly-leaves
  tied together.</p>

  <p>"Argent, an almond-slip proper" is the coat of arms attributed to a
  family of Almond, and Papworth assigns "Argent, a barberry-branch fructed
  proper" to Berry.</p>

  <p>"Argent, three sprigs of balm flowered proper" is stated to be the
  coat of a family named Balme, and "Argent, three teasels slipped proper"
  the coat of Bowden, whilst Boden of the Friary bears, "Argent, a chevron
  sable between three teasels proper, a bordure of the second." A teasle on
  a canton figures in the arms of Chichester-Constable.</p>

  <p>The Company of Tobacco-Pipe Makers in London, incorporated in the year
  1663, bore: "Argent, on a mount in base vert, three plants of tobacco
  growing and flowering all proper." The crest recently granted to Sir
  Thomas Lipton, Bart. ["On a wreath of the colours, two arms in saltire,
  the dexter surmounted by the sinister <!-- Page 266 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="304.png"><a name="page266"></a>{266}</span>holding
  a sprig of the tea-plant erect, and the other a like sprig of the
  coffee-plant both slipped and leaved proper, vested above the elbow
  argent"], affords an example of both the coffee-plant and the tea-plant,
  which have both assisted him so materially in piling up his immense
  fortune. "Or, three birch-twigs sable" is the coat of Birches, and "Or, a
  bunch of nettles vert" is the coat of Mallerby of Devonshire. The pun in
  the last case is apparent.</p>

  <p><i>The Cotton-Plant</i> figures in the arms of the towns of Darwen,
  Rochdale, and Nelson, and two culms of the papyrus plant occur in the
  arms of the town of Bury.</p>

  <p><i>The Coffee-Plant</i> also figures in the arms of Yockney: "Azure, a
  chevron or, between a ship under sail in chief proper, and a sprig of the
  coffee-plant slipped in base of the second."</p>

  <p>A branch, slip, bush, or tree is termed "fructed" when the fruit is
  shown, though the term is usually disregarded unless "fructed" of a
  different colour. When represented as "fructed," the fruit is usually
  drawn out of all proportion to its relative size.</p>

  <p>Leaves are not infrequent in their appearance. Holly-leaves occur in
  the various coats for most people of the name of Irwin and Irvine, as
  already mentioned. Laurel-leaves occur in the arms of Leveson-Gower,
  Foulis, and Foulds.</p>

  <p><i>Oak-Leaves</i> occur in the arms of Trelawney ["Argent, a chevron
  sable, between three oak-leaves slipped proper"]; and <i>hazel-leaves</i>
  in the arms of Hesilrige or Hazlerigg ["Argent, a chevron sable, between
  three hazel-leaves vert].</p>

  <p>"Argent, three edock (dock or burdock) leaves vert" is the coat of
  Hepburn. Papworth assigns "Argent, an aspen leaf proper" to Aspinal, and
  "Or, a betony-leaf proper" to Betty. "Argent, three aspen-leaves" is an
  unauthorised coat used by Espin, and the same coat with varying tinctures
  is assigned to Cogan. Killach is stated to bear: "Azure, three bay-leaves
  argent," and to Woodward, of Little Walsingham, Norfolk, was granted in
  1806: "Vert, three mulberry-leaves or."</p>

  <p><i>The Maple-Leaf</i> has been generally adopted as a Canadian emblem,
  and consequently figures upon the arms of that Dominion, and in the arms
  of many families which have or have had Canadian associations.</p>

  <p>"Vert, three vine-leaves or" is assigned by Papworth to Wortford, and
  the same authority mentions coats in which woodbine-leaves occur for
  Browne, Theme, and Gamboa. Rose-leaves occur in the arms of Utermarck,
  and walnut-leaves figure in the arms of Waller.</p>

  <p>A curious leaf&mdash;usually called the "sea-leaf," which is properly
  the "nenuphar-leaf," is often met with in German heraldry, as are
  <i>Linden</i> leaves.</p>

  <p>Although theoretically leaves, the trefoil, quatrefoil, and cinquefoil
  <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum" title="305.png"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>are a class by themselves, having a
  recognised heraldic status as exclusively heraldic charges, and the
  quatrefoil and cinquefoil, in spite of the derivation of their names, are
  as likely to have been originally flowers as leaves.</p>

  <p><i>The heraldic Trefoil</i> (Fig. 487), though frequently specifically
  described as "slipped," is nevertheless always so depicted, and it is not
  necessary to so describe it. Of late a tendency has been noticeable in
  paintings from Ulster's Office to represent the trefoil in a way more
  nearly approaching the Irish shamrock, from which it has undoubtedly been
  derived. Instances of the trefoil occur in the arms of Rodd, Dobrée,
  MacDermott, and Gilmour. The crowned trefoil is one of the national
  badges of Ireland.</p>

</td></tr></table>

  <p>A four-leaved "lucky" shamrock has been introduced into the arms of
  Sir Robert Hart, Bart.</p>

  <p><i>The Quatrefoil</i> (Fig. 488) is not often met with, but it occurs
  in the arms of Eyre, King, and Dreyer.</p>

  <p><i>The Cinquefoil</i> (Fig. 489) is of frequent appearance, but, save
  in exceedingly rare instances, neither the quatrefoil nor the cinquefoil
  will be met with "slipped." The constant occurrence of the cinquefoil in
  early rolls of arms is out of all proportion to its distinctiveness or
  artistic beauty, and the frequency with which it is met with in
  conjunction with the cross crosslet points clearly to the fact that there
  is some allusion behind, if this could only be fathomed. Many a man might
  adopt a lion through independent choice, but one would not expect
  independent choice to lead so many to pitch upon a combination of cross
  crosslets and cinquefoils. The cross crosslets, I am confident, are a
  later addition in many cases, for the original arms of D'Arcy, for
  example, were simply: "Argent, three cinquefoils gules." The arms of the
  town of Leicester are: "Gules, a cinquefoil ermine," and this is the coat
  attributed to the family of the De Beaumonts or De Bellomonts, Earls of
  Leicester. Simon de Montfort, the great Earl of Leicester, was the son or
  grandson of Amicia, a coheir of the former Earls, and as such <!-- Page
  268 --><span class="pagenum" title="306.png"><a
  name="page268"></a>{268}</span>entitled to quarter the arms of the De
  Bellomonts. As stated on page <a href="#page117">117</a> (<i>vide</i>
  Figs. 97 and 98), there are two coats attributed to De Montfort. His only
  status in this country depended solely upon the De Bellomont inheritance,
  and, conformably with the custom of the period, we are far more likely to
  find him using arms of De Bellomont or De Beaumont than of Montfort. From
  the similarity of the charge to the better-known Beaumont arms, I am
  inclined to think the lion rampant to be the real De Bellomont coat. The
  origin of the cinquefoil has yet to be accounted for. The earliest De
  Bellomont for whom I can find proof of user thereof is Robert
  "Fitz-Pernell," otherwise De Bellomont, who died in 1206, and whose seal
  (Fig. 490) shows it. Be it noted it is not on a shield, and though of
  course this is not proof in any way, it is in accord with my suggestion
  that it is nothing more than a pimpernel flower adopted as a device or
  badge to typify his own name and his mother's name, she being Pernelle or
  Petronilla, the heiress of Grantmesnil. The cinquefoil was not the coat
  of Grantmesnil but a quaint little conceit, and is not therefore likely
  to have been used as a coat of arms by the De Bellomonts, though no doubt
  they used it as a badge and device, as no doubt did Simon de Montfort.
  Simon de Montfort split England into two parties. Men were for Montfort
  or the king, and those that were for De Montfort very probably took and
  used his badge of a cinquefoil as a party badge.</p>

    the seal of Robert Fitz-Pernell, Earl of Leicester, <i>d.</i> 1206.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The cinquefoil in its ordinary heraldic form also occurs in the arms
  of Umfraville, Bardolph, Hamilton, and D'Arcy, and sprigs of cinquefoil
  will be found in the arms of Hill, and in the crest of Kersey. The
  cinquefoil is sometimes found pierced. The five-foiled flower being the
  blossom of so many plants, what are to all intents and purposes
  cinquefoils occur in the arms of Fraser, where they are termed "fraises,"
  of Primrose, where they are blazoned "primroses," and of Lambert, where
  they are called "narcissus flowers."</p>

  <p><i>The double Quatrefoil</i> is cited as the English difference mark
  for the ninth son, but as these difference marks are but seldom used, and
  as ninth sons are somewhat of a rarity, it is seldom indeed that this
  particular mark is seen in use. Personally I have never seen it.</p>

  <p><i>The Turnip</i> makes an early appearance in armory, and occurs in
  the coat of Dammant ["Sable, a turnip leaved proper, a chief or,
  gutté-de-poix"]. <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum" title="307.png"
  ><a name="page269"></a>{269}</span></p>

  <p>The curious crest of Lingen, which is "Seven leeks root upwards
  issuing from a ducal coronet all proper," is worthy of especial
  mention.</p>

  <p>In considering flowers as a charge, a start must naturally be made
  with the rose, which figures so prominently in the heraldry of
  England.</p>

  <p><i>The heraldic Rose</i> until a much later date than its first
  appearance in armory&mdash;it occurs, however, at the earliest
  period&mdash;was always represented in what we now term the
  "conventional" form, with five displayed petals (Fig. 491). Accustomed as
  we are to the more ornate form of the cultivated rose of the garden,
  those who speak of the "conventional" heraldic rose rather seem to
  overlook that it is an exact reproduction of the wild rose of the
  hedgerow, which, morever, has a tendency to show itself "displayed" and
  not in the more profile attitude we are perhaps accustomed to. It should
  also be observed that the earliest representations of the heraldic rose
  depict the intervening spaces between the petals which are noticeable in
  the wild rose. Under the Tudor sovereigns, the heraldic rose often shows
  a double row of petals, a fact which is doubtless accounted for by the
  then increasing familiarity with the cultivated variety, and also by the
  attempt to conjoin the rival emblems of the warring factions of York and
  Lancaster.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:13%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    492.</span>&mdash;Rose slipped and leaved.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Though the heraldic rose is seldom, if ever, otherwise depicted, it
  should be described as "barbed vert" and "seeded or" (or "barbed and
  seeded proper") when the centre seeds and the small intervening green
  leaves (the calyx) between the petals are represented in their natural
  colours. In the reign of the later Tudor sovereigns the conventionality
  of earlier heraldic art was slowly beginning to give way to the pure
  naturalism towards which heraldic art thereafter steadily degenerated,
  and we find that the rose then begins (both as a Royal badge and
  elsewhere) to be met with "slipped and leaved" (Fig. 492). The Royal
  fleurs-de-lis are turned into natural lilies in the grant of arms to Eton
  College, and in the grant to William Cope, Cofferer to Henry VII., the
  roses are slipped ["Argent, on a chevron azure, between three roses
  gules, slipped and leaved vert, as many fleurs-de-lis or. Crest: out of a
  fleur-de-lis or, a dragon's head gules"]. A rose when "slipped"
  theoretically has only a stalk added, but in practice it will always have
  at least one leaf added to the slip, and a rose "slipped and leaved"
  would <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum" title="308.png"><a
  name="page270"></a>{270}</span>have a leaf on either side. A rose
  "stalked and leaved" is not so limited, and will usually be found with a
  slightly longer stalk and several leaves; but these technical refinements
  of blazon, which are really unnecessary, are not greatly observed or
  taken into account. The arms of the Burgh of Montrose afford an example
  of a single rose as the only charge, although other instances will be met
  with in the arms of Boscawen, Viscount Falmouth ["Ermine, a rose gules,
  barbed and seeded proper"], and of Nightingale, Bart. ["Per pale ermine
  and gules, a rose counterchanged"].</p>

  <p>Amongst the scores of English arms in which the rose figures, it will
  be found in the original heraldic form in the case of the arms of
  Southampton (Plate VII.); and either stalked or slipped in the arms of
  Brodribb and White-Thomson. A curious instance of the use of the rose
  will be found in the crest of Bewley, and the "cultivated" rose was
  depicted in the emblazonment of the crest of Inverarity, which is a
  rose-bush proper.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig493.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig493.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    493.</span>&mdash;Thistle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Heraldry, with its roses, has accomplished what horticulture has not.
  There is an old legend that when Henry VII. succeeded to the English
  throne some enterprising individual produced a natural parti-coloured
  rose which answered to the conjoined heraldic rose of gules and argent.
  Our roses "or" may really find their natural counterpart in the primrose,
  but the arms of Rochefort ["Quarterly or and azure, four roses
  counterchanged"] give us the <i>blue</i> rose, the arms of Berendon
  ["Argent, three roses sable"] give us the <i>black</i> rose, and the coat
  of Smallshaw ["Argent, a rose vert, between three shakeforks sable"] is
  the long-desired <i>green</i> rose.</p>

  <p><i>The Thistle</i> (Fig. 493) ranks next to the rose in British
  heraldic importance. Like the rose, the reason of its assumption as a
  national badge remains largely a matter of mystery, though it is of
  nothing like so ancient an origin. Of course one knows the time-honoured
  and wholly impossible legend that its adoption as a national symbol dates
  from the battle of Largs, when one of the Danish invaders gave away an
  attempted surprise by his cry of agony caused by stepping barefooted upon
  a thistle.</p>

  <p>The fact, however, remains that its earliest appearance is on the
  silver coinage of 1474, in the reign of James III., but during that reign
  there can be no doubt that it was accepted either as a national badge or
  else as the personal badge of the sovereign. The period in question was
  that in which badges were so largely used, and it is not unlikely that,
  desiring to vie with his brother of England, and fired by the <!-- Page
  271 --><span class="pagenum" title="309.png"><a
  name="page271"></a>{271}</span>example of the broom badge and the rose
  badge, the Scottish king, remembering the ancient legend, chose the
  thistle as his own badge. In 1540, when the thistle had become recognised
  as one of the national emblems of the kingdom, the foundation of the
  Order of the Thistle stereotyped the fact for all future time. The
  conventional heraldic representation of the thistle is as it appears upon
  the star of that Order, that is, the flowered head upon a short stalk
  with a leaf on either side. Though sometimes represented of gold, it is
  nearly always proper. It has frequently been granted as an augmentation,
  though in such a meaning it will usually be found crowned. The coat of
  augmentation carried in the first quarter of his arms by Lord Torphichen
  is: "Argent, a thistle vert, flowered gules (really a thistle proper), on
  a chief azure an imperial crown or." "Sable, a thistle (possibly really a
  teasel) or, between three pheons argent" is the coat of Teesdale, and
  "Gules, three thistles or" is attributed in Papworth to Hawkey. A curious
  use of the thistle occurs in the arms of the National Bank of Scotland
  (granted 1826), which are: "Or, the image of St. Andrew with vesture
  vert, and surcoat purpure, bearing before him the cross of his martyrdom
  argent, all resting on a base of the second, in the dexter flank a garb
  gules, in the sinister a ship in full sail sable, <i>the shield
  surrounded with two thistles proper disposed in orle</i>."</p>

  <p><i>The Lily</i> in its natural form sometimes occurs, though of course
  it generally figures as the fleur-de-lis, which will presently be
  considered. The natural lily will be found in the arms of Aberdeen
  University, of Dundee, and in the crests of various families of the name
  of Chadwick. It also occurs in the arms of the College of St. Mary the
  Virgin, at Eton ["Sable, three lilies argent, on a chief per pale azure
  and gules a fleur-de-lis on the dexter side, and a lion passant guardant
  or on the sinister"]. Here they doubtless typify the Virgin, to whom they
  have reference; as also in the case of Marylebone (Fig. 252).</p>

  <p>The arms of Lilly, of Stoke Prior, are: "Gules, three lilies slipped
  argent;" and the arms of J. E. Lilley, Esq., of Harrow, are: "Azure, on a
  pile between two fleurs-de-lis argent, a lily of the valley eradicated
  proper. Crest: on a wreath of the colours, a cubit arm erect proper,
  charged with a fleur-de-lis argent and holding in the hand two lilies of
  the valley, leaved and slipped in saltire, also proper."</p>

  <p><i>Columbine Flowers</i> occur in the arms of Cadman, and
  <i>Gillyflowers</i> in the arms of Livingstone.
  <i>Fraises</i>&mdash;really the flowers of the
  strawberry-plant&mdash;occur, as has been already mentioned, in the arms
  of Fraser, and <i>Narcissus Flowers</i> in the arms of Lambeth. "Gules,
  three poppy bolles on their stalks in fess or" are the arms of
  Boller.</p>

  <p><i>The Lotus-Flower</i>, which is now very generally becoming the
  recognised emblem of India, is constantly met with in the arms granted to
  <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum" title="310.png"><a

  in that country. Instances in which it occurs are the arms of Sir Roper
  Lethbridge, K.C.I.E., Sir Thomas Seccombe, G.C.I.E., and the University
  of Madras.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sylphium-Plant</i> occurs in the arms of General Sir Henry
  Augustus Smyth, K.C.M.G., which are: Vert, a chevron erminois, charged
  with a chevron gules, between three Saracens' heads habited in profile
  couped at the neck proper, and for augmentation a chief argent, thereon a
  mount vert inscribed with the Greek letters K Y P A gold and issuant
  therefrom a representation of the plant Silphium proper. Crests: 1. (of
  augmentation) on a wreath of the colours, a mount vert inscribed with the
  aforesaid Greek letters and issuant therefrom the Silphium as in the
  arms; 2. on a wreath of the colours, an anchor fesswise sable, thereon an
  ostrich erminois holding in the beak a horse-shoe or. Motto: "Vincere est
  vivere."</p>

  <p>The arms granted to Sir Richard Quain were: "Argent, a chevron
  engrailed azure, in chief two fers-de-moline gules, and issuant from the
  base a rock covered with daisies proper."</p>

  <p><i>Primroses</i> occur (as was only to be expected) in the arms of the
  Earl of Rosebery ["Vert, three primroses within a double tressure flory
  counterflory or"].</p>

  <p><i>The Sunflower</i> or <i>Marigold</i> occurs in the crest of Buchan
  ["A sunflower in full bloom towards the sun in the dexter chief"], and
  also in the arms granted in 1614 to Florio. Here, however, the flower is
  termed a heliotrope. The arms in question are: "Azure, a heliotrope or,
  issuing from a stalk sprouting from two leaves vert, in chief the sun in
  splendour proper."</p>

  <p><i>Tulips</i> occur in the arms of Raphael, and the <i>Cornflower</i>
  or <i>Bluebottle</i> in the arms of Chorley of Chorley, Lancs. ["Argent,
  a chevron gules between three bluebottles slipped proper"], and also in
  the more modern arms of that town.</p>

  <p><i>Saffron-Flowers</i> are a charge upon the arms of Player of
  Nottingham. The arms granted to Sir Edgar Boehm, Bart., were: "Azure, in
  the sinister canton a sun issuant therefrom eleven rays, over all a
  clover-plant eradicated proper."</p>

  <p><i>The Fleur-de-Lis.</i>&mdash;Few figures have puzzled the antiquary
  so much as the fleur-de-lis. Countless origins have been suggested for
  it; we have even lately had the height of absurdity urged in a suggested
  phallic origin, which only rivals in ridiculousness the long since
  exploded legend that the fleurs-de-lis in the arms of France were a <!--
  Page 273 --><span class="pagenum" title="311.png"><a
  name="page273"></a>{273}</span>corrupted form of an earlier coat, "Azure,
  three toads or," the reputed coat of arms of Pharamond!</p>

  <p>To France and the arms of France one must turn for the origin of the
  heraldic use of the fleur-de-lis. To begin with, the form of the
  fleur-de-lis as a mere presumably meaningless form of decoration is found
  long before the days of armory, in fact from the earliest period of
  decoration. It is such an essentially natural development of decoration
  that it may be accepted as such without any attempt to give it a meaning
  or any symbolism. Its earliest heraldic appearances as the finial of a
  sceptre or the decoration of a coronet need not have had any symbolical
  character.</p>

  <p>We then find the "lily" accepted as having some symbolical reference
  to France, and it should be remembered that the iris was known by the
  name of a lily until comparatively modern times.</p>

  <p>It is curious&mdash;though possibly in this case it may be only a
  coincidence&mdash;that, on a coin of the Emperor Hadrian, Gaul is
  typified by a female figure holding in the hand a lily, the legend being,
  "Restutori Galliæ." The fleur-de-lis as the finial of a sceptre and as an
  ornament of a crown can be taken back to the fifth century. Fleurs-de-lis
  upon crowns and coronets in France are at least as old as the reign of
  King Robert (son of Hugh Capet) whose seal represents him crowned in this
  manner.</p>

  <p>We have, moreover, the ancient legendary tradition that at the baptism
  of Clovis, King of the Franks, the Virgin (whose emblem the lily has
  always been) sent a lily by an angel as a mark of her special favour. It
  is difficult to determine the exact date at which this tradition was
  invented, but its accepted character may be judged from the fact that it
  was solemnly advanced by the French bishops at the Council of Trent in a
  dispute as to the precedence of their sovereign. The old legend as to
  Clovis would naturally identify the flower with him, and it should be
  noted that the names Clovis, Lois, Loys, and Louis are identical. "Loys"
  was the signature of the kings of France until the time of Louis XIII. It
  is worth the passing conjecture that what are sometimes termed "Cleves
  lilies" may be a corrupted form of Clovis lilies. There can be little
  doubt that the term "fleur-de-lis" is quite as likely to be a corruption
  of "fleur-de-lois" as flower of the lily. The chief point is that the
  desire was to represent a <i>flower</i> in allusion to the old legend,
  without perhaps any very definite certainty of the flower intended to be
  represented. Philip I. on his seal (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1060)
  holds a short staff terminating in a fleur-de-lis. The same object occurs
  in the great seal of Louis VII. In the seal of his wife, Queen Constance,
  we find her represented as holding in either hand a similar object,
  though in these last cases it is by no means certain that the objects are
  not attempts to represent the natural flower. A signet <!-- Page 274
  --><span class="pagenum" title="312.png"><a
  name="page274"></a>{274}</span>of Louis VII. bears a single fleur-de-lis
  "florencée" (or flowered), and in his reign the heraldic fleur-de-lis
  undoubtedly became stereotyped as a symbolical device, for we find that
  when in the lifetime of Louis VII. his son Philip was crowned, the king
  prescribed that the prince should wear "ses chausses appelées sandales ou
  bottines de soye, couleur bleu azuré sémée en moult endroits de
  fleurs-de-lys or, puis aussi sa dalmatique de même couleur et
  &oelig;uvre." On the oval counter-seal of Philip II. (<i>d.</i> 1223)
  appears a heraldic fleur-de-lis. His great seal, as also that of Louis
  VIII., shows a seated figure crowned with an open crown of "fleurons,"
  and holding in his right hand a flower, and in his left a sceptre
  surmounted by a heraldic fleur-de-lis enclosed within a lozenge-shaped
  frame. On the seal of Louis VIII. the conjunction of the essentially
  heraldic fleur-de-lis (within the lozenge-shaped head of the sceptre),
  and the more natural flower held in the hand, should leave little if any
  doubt of the intention to represent flowers in the French fleurs-de-lis.
  The figure held in the hand represents a flower of five petals. The upper
  pair turned inwards to touch the centre one, and the lower pair curved
  downwards, leave the figure with a marked resemblance both to the iris
  and to the conventional fleur-de-lis. The counter-seal of Louis VIII.
  shows a Norman-shaped shield semé of fleurs-de-lis of the conventional
  heraldic pattern. By then, of course, "Azure, semé-de-lis or" had become
  the fixed and determined arms of France. By an edict dated 1376, Charles
  V. reduced the number of fleurs-de-lis in his shield to three: "Pour
  symboliser la Sainte-Trinite."</p>

  <p>The claim of Edward III. to the throne of France was made on the death
  of Charles IV. of France in 1328, but the decision being against him, he
  apparently acquiesced, and did homage to Philip of Valois (Philip VI.)
  for Guienne. Philip, however, lent assistance to David II. of Scotland
  against King Edward, who immediately renewed his claim to France, assumed
  the arms and the title of king of that country, and prepared for war. He
  commenced hostilities in 1339, and upon his new Great Seal (made in the
  early part of 1340) we find his arms represented upon shield, surcoat,
  and housings as: "Quarterly, 1 and 4, azure, semé-de-lis or (for France);
  2 and 3, gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or (for England)."
  The Royal Arms thus remained until 1411, when upon the second Great Seal
  of Henry IV. the fleurs-de-lis in England (as in France) were reduced to
  three in number, and so remained as part of the Royal Arms of this
  country until the latter part of the reign of George III.</p>

  <p>Fleurs-de-lis (probably intended as badges only) had figured upon all
  the Great Seals of Edward III. On the first seal (which with slight
  alterations had also served for both Edward I. and II.), a small <!--
  Page 275 --><span class="pagenum" title="313.png"><a
  name="page275"></a>{275}</span>fleur-de-lis appears over each of the
  castles which had previously figured on either side of the throne. In the
  second Great Seal, fleurs-de-lis took the places of the castles.</p>

  <p>The similarity of the Montgomery arms to the Royal Arms of France has
  led to all kinds of wild genealogical conjectures, but at a time when the
  arms of France were hardly determinate, the seal of John de Mundegumbri
  is met with, bearing a single fleur-de-lis, the original from which the
  arms of Montgomery were developed. Letters of nobility and the name of Du
  Lis were granted by Charles VII. in December 1429 to the brothers of Joan
  of Arc, and the following arms were then assigned to them: "Azure, a
  sword in pale proper, hilted and supporting on its point an open crown
  or, between two fleurs-de-lis of the last."</p>

  <p>The fleur-de-lis "florencée," or the "fleur-de-lis flowered," as it is
  termed in England, is officially considered a distinct charge from the
  simple fleur-de-lis. Eve employs the term "seeded," and remarks of it:
  "This being one of the numerous instances of pedantic, because
  unnecessary distinction, which showed marks of decadence; for both forms
  occur at the same period, and adorn the same object, evidently with the
  same intention." The difference between these forms really is that the
  fleur-de-lis is "seeded" when a stalk having seeds at the end issues in
  the upper interstices. In a fleur-de-lis "florencée," the natural flower
  of a lily issues instead of the seeded stalk. This figure formed the arms
  of the city of Florence.</p>

  <p>Fleurs-de-lis, like all other Royal emblems, are frequently to be met
  with in the arms of towns, <i>e.g.</i> in the arms of Lancaster,
  Maryborough, Wakefield, and Great Torrington. The arms of Wareham afford
  an instance of fleurs-de-lis reversed, and the Corporate Seals of
  Liskeard and Tamworth merit reproduction, did space permit, from the
  designs of the fleurs-de-lis which there appear. One cannot leave the
  fleur-de-lis without referring to one curious development of it, viz. the
  leopard's face jessant-de-lis (Fig. 332), a curious charge which
  undoubtedly originated in the arms of the family of Cantelupe. This
  charge is not uncommon, though by no means so usual as the leopard's
  face. Planché considers that it was originally derived from the
  fleur-de-lis, the circular boss which in early representations so often
  figures as the centre of the fleur-de-lis, being merely <i>decorated</i>
  with the leopard's face. One can follow Planché a bit further by
  imagining that this face need not necessarily be that of a leopard, for
  at a certain period all decorative art was crowded with grotesque masks
  whenever opportunity offered. The leopard's face jessant-de-lis is now
  represented as a leopard's face with the lower part of a fleur-de-lis
  issuing from the mouth, and the upper part rising from behind the head.
  Instances of <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum" title="314.png"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span>this charge occur as early as the
  thirteenth century as the arms of the Cantelupe family, and Thomas de
  Cantelupe having been Bishop of Hereford 1275 to 1282, the arms of that
  See have since been three leopards' faces jessant-de-lis, the distinction
  being that in the arms of the See of Hereford the leopards' faces are
  reversed.</p>

  <p>The origin may perhaps make itself apparent when we remember that the
  earliest form of the name was Cantelowe. Is it not probable that "lions'"
  faces (<i>i.e.</i> head <i>de leo</i>) may have been suggested by the
  name? Possibly, however, wolf-heads may have been meant, suggested by
  <i>lupus</i>, or by the same analogy which gives us wolf-heads or wolves
  upon the arms of Low and Lowe.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Fruit&mdash;the remaining division of those charges which can be
  classed as belonging to the vegetable kingdom&mdash;must of necessity be
  but briefly dealt with.</p>

  <p><i>Grapes</i> perhaps cannot be easily distinguished from vines (to
  which refer, page <a href="#page264">264</a>), but the arms of Bradway of
  Potscliff, co. Gloucester ["Argent, a chevron gules between three bunches
  of grapes proper"] and of Viscountess Beaconsfield, the daughter of
  Captain John Viney Evans ["Argent, a bunch of grapes stalked and leaved
  proper, between two flaunches sable, each charged with a boar's head
  argent"] are instances in point.</p>

  <p><i>Apples</i> occur in the arms of Robert Applegarth (Edward III.
  Roll) ["Argent, three apples slipped gules"] and "Or, a chevron between
  three apples gules" is the coat of a family named Southbey.</p>

  <p><i>Pears</i> occur in the arms of Allcroft, of Stokesay Castle,
  Perrins, Perry, Perryman, and Pirie.</p>

  <p><i>Oranges</i> are but seldom met with in British heraldry, but an
  instance occurs in the arms of Lord Polwarth, who bears over the Hepburn
  quarterings an inescutcheon azure, an orange slipped and surmounted by an
  imperial crown all proper. This was an augmentation conferred by King
  William III., and a very similar augmentation (in the 1st and 4th
  quarters, azure, three oranges slipped proper within an orle of thistles
  or) was granted to Livingstone, Viscount Teviot.</p>

  <p><i>The Pomegranate</i> (Fig. 495), which dimidiated with a rose was
  one of the badges of Queen Mary, is not infrequently met with.</p>

  <p><i>The Pineapple</i> in heraldry is nearly always the fir-cone. In the
  arms of Perring, Bart. ["Argent, on a chevron engrailed sable between
  three pineapples (fir-cones) pendent vert, as many leopards' faces of the
  first. Crest: on a mount a pineapple (fir-cone) vert"], and in the crest
  of Parkyns, Bart. ["Out of a ducal coronet or, a pineapple <!-- Page 277
  --><span class="pagenum" title="315.png"><a
  name="page277"></a>{277}</span>proper"], and also in the arms of Pyne
  ["Gules, a chevron ermine between three pineapples or"] and Parkin-Moore,
  the fruit is the fir or pine cone. Latterly the likelihood of confusion
  has led to the general use of the term "pine-cone" in such cases, but the
  ancient description was certainly "pineapple." The arms of John Apperley,
  as given in the Edward III. Roll, are: "Argent, a chevron gules between
  three pineapples (fir-cones) vert, slipped or."</p>

  <p>The real pineapple of the present day does, however, occur,
  <i>e.g.</i> in the arms of Benson, of Lutwyche, Shropshire ["Argent, on
  waves of the sea, an old English galley all proper, on a chief wavy azure
  a hand couped at the wrist, supporting on a dagger the scales of Justice
  between two pineapples erect or, leaved vert. Mantling azure and argent.
  Crest: upon a wreath of the colours, a horse caparisoned, passant,
  proper, on the breast a shield argent, charged with a pineapple proper.

  <p><i>Bean-Pods</i> occur in the arms of Rise of Trewardreva, co.
  Cornwall ["Argent, a chevron gules between three bean-pods vert"], and
  Papworth mentions in the arms of Messarney an instance of cherries ["Or,
  a chevron per pale gules and vert between three cherries of the second
  slipped of the third"]. Elsewhere, however, the charges on the shield of
  this family are termed apples. Strawberries occur in the arms and crest
  of Hollist, and the arms of Duffield are: "Sable, a chevron between three
  cloves or." The arms of the Grocers' Livery Company, granted in
  1531-1532, are: "Argent, a chevron gules between nine cloves, three,
  three and three." The arms of Garwynton are stated to be: "Sable, a
  chevron between three heads of garlick pendent argent," but another
  version gives the charges as pomegranates. "Azure, a chevron between
  three gourds pendent, slipped or" is a coat attributed to Stukele, but
  here again there is uncertainty, as the charges are sometimes quoted as
  pears. The arms of Bonefeld are: "Azure, a chevron between three quinces
  or." The arms of Alderberry are naturally: "Argent, three branches of
  alder-berries proper." The arms of Haseley of Suffolk are: "Argent, a
  fess gules, between three hazel-nuts or, stalks and leaves vert."
  Papworth also mentions the arms of Tarsell, viz.: "Or, a chevron sable,
  between three hazel-nuts erect, slipped gules." It would, however, seem
  more probable that these charges are really teazles.</p>

  <p>The fruit of the oak&mdash;the <i>Acorn</i> (Fig. 496)&mdash;has
  already been incidentally referred to, but other instances occur in the
  arms of Baldwin, Stable, and Huth. <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum" title="316.png"

  <p>Wheat and other grain is constantly met with in British armory. The
  arms of Bigland ["Azure, two ears of big wheat erect in fess and bladed
  or"] and of Cheape are examples, and others occur in the arms of
  Layland-Barratt, Cross, and Rye ["Gules, on a bend argent, between two
  ears of rye, stalked, leaved, and slipped or, three crosses cramponné
  sable"].</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    497.</span>&mdash;Garb.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Garbs</i>, as they are invariably termed heraldically, are sheaves,
  and are of very frequent occurrence. The earliest appearance of the garb
  (Fig. 497) in English heraldry is on the seal of Ranulph, Earl of
  Chester, who died in 1232. Garbs therefrom became identified with the
  Earldom of Chester, and subsequently "Azure, three garbs or" became and
  still remain the territorial or possibly the sovereign coat of that
  earldom. Garbs naturally figure, therefore, in the arms of many families
  who originally held land by feudal tenure under the Earls of Chester,
  e.g. the families of Cholmondeley ["Gules, in chief two helmets in
  profile argent, and in base a garb vert"] and Kevilioc ["Azure, six
  garbs, three, two, and one or"]. Grosvenor ["Azure, a garb or"] is
  usually quoted as another example, and possibly correctly, but a very
  interesting origin has been suggested by Mr. W. G. Taunton in his work
  "The Tauntons of Oxford, by One of Them":&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I merely wish to make a few remarks of my own that seem to have
  escaped other writers on genealogical matters.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, Sir Gilbert le Grosvenor, who is stated to have
  come over with William of Normandy at the Conquest, is described as
  nephew to Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester; but Hugh Lupus was himself nephew
  to King William. Now, William could not have been very old when he
  overthrew Harold at Hastings. It seems, therefore, rather improbable that
  Sir Gilbert le Grosvenor, who was his nephew's nephew, could actually
  have fought with him at Hastings, especially when William lived to reign
  for twenty-one years after, and was not very old when he died.</p>

  <p>"The name Grosvenor does not occur in any of the versions of the Roll
  of Battle Abbey. Not that any of these versions of this celebrated Roll
  are considered authentic by modern critics, who say that many names were
  subsequently added by the monks to please ambitious parvenus. The name
  Venour is on the Roll, however, and it is just possible that this Venour
  was the Grosvenor of our quest. The addition of 'Gros' would then be
  subsequent to his fattening on the spoils of the Saxon and cultivating a
  corporation. 'Venour' means hunter, and <!-- Page 279 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="317.png"><a name="page279"></a>{279}</span>'Gros'
  means fat. Gilbert's uncle, Hugh Lupus, was, we know, a fat man; in fact,
  he was nicknamed 'Hugh the Fat.' The Grosvenors of that period probably
  inherited obesity from their relative, Hugh Lupus, therefore, and the
  fable that they were called Grosvenor on account of their office of
  'Great Huntsman' to the Dukes of Normandy is not to be relied on.</p>

  <p>"We are further on told by the old family historians that when Sir
  Robert Grosvenor lost the day in that ever-memorable controversy with Sir
  Richard le Scrope, Baron of Bolton, concerning the coat of
  arms&mdash;'Azure, a bend or'&mdash;borne by both families, Sir Robert
  Grosvenor took for his arms one of the garbs of his kinsman, the Earl of
  Chester.</p>

  <p>"It did not seem to occur to these worthies that the Earl of Chester,
  who was their ancestor's uncle, never bore the garbs in his arms, but a
  wolf's head.</p>

  <p>"It is true that one or two subsequent Earls of Chester bore garbs,
  but these Earls were far too distantly connected with the Grosvenors to
  render it likely that the latter would borrow their new arms from this
  source.</p>

  <p>"It is curious that there should have been in this same county of
  Chester a family of almost identical name also bearing a garb in their
  arms, though their garb was surrounded by three bezants.</p>

  <p>"The name of this family was Grasvenor, or Gravenor, and, moreover,
  the tinctures of their arms were identical with those of Grosvenor. It is
  far more likely, therefore, that the coat assumed by Sir Robert after the
  adverse decision of the Court of Chivalry was taken from that of
  Grasvenor, or Gravenor, and that the two families were known at that time
  to be of common origin, although their connection with each other has
  subsequently been lost.</p>

  <p>"In French both <i>gros</i> and <i>gras</i> mean fat, and we have both
  forms in Grosvenor and Grasvenor.</p>

  <p>"A chief huntsman to Royalty would have been Grandvenor, not Grosvenor
  or Grasvenor.</p>

  <p>"All these criticisms of mine, however, only affect the origin of the
  arms, and not the ancient and almost Royal descent of this illustrious
  race. Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, was a son of the Duke of Brittany, as
  is plainly stated in his epitaph.</p>

  <p>"This connection of uncle and nephew, then, between 'Hugh the Fat' and
  Gilbert Grosvenor implies a maternal descent from the Dukes of Brittany
  for the first ancestor of the Grosvenor family.</p>

  <p>"In virtue of their descent from an heiress of the house of Grosvenor,
  it is only necessary to add the Tauntons of Oxford are Grosvenors,
  heraldically speaking, and that quartering so many ancient coats through
  <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum" title="318.png"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span>the Tanners and the Grosvenors with our
  brand-new grant is like putting old wine into new bottles.</p>

  <p>"Hugh Lupus left no son to succeed him, and the subsequent descent of
  the Earldom of Chester was somewhat erratic. So I think there is some
  point in my arguments regarding the coat assumed by Sir Robert Grosvenor
  of Hulme."</p>

  <p>Though a garb, unless quoted otherwise, is presumed to be a sheaf of
  wheat, the term is not so confined. The garbs in the arms of Comyn, which
  figure as a quartering in so many Scottish coats, are really of cummin,
  as presumably are the garbs in the arms of Cummins. When a garb is
  "banded" of a different colour this should be stated, and Elvin states
  that it may be "eared" of a different colour, though I confess I am aware
  of no such instance.</p>

  <p>"Argent, two bundles of reeds in fess vert," is the coat of Janssen of
  Wimbledon, Surrey (Bart., extinct), and a bundle of rods occurs in the
  arms of Evans, and the crest of Harris, though in this latter case it is
  termed a faggot.</p>

  <p><i>Reeds</i> also occur in the crest of Reade, and the crest of
  Middlemore ["On a wreath of colours, a moorcock amidst grass and reeds
  proper"] furnishes another example.</p>

  <p><i>Bulrushes</i> occur in the crest of Billiat, and in the arms of
  Scott ["Argent, on a mount of bulrushes in base proper, a bull passant
  sable, a chief pean, billetté or"].</p>

  <p><i>Grass</i> is naturally presumed on the mounts vert which are so
  constantly met with, but more definite instances can be found in the arms
  of Sykes, Hulley, and Hill. <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum" title="319.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XIX</h5>

<h5>INANIMATE OBJECTS</h5>

  <p>In dealing with those charges which may be classed under the above
  description one can safely say that there is scarcely an object under the
  sun which has not at some time or other been introduced into a coat of
  arms or crest. One cannot usefully make a book on armory assume the
  character of a general encyclopædia of useful knowledge, and reference
  will only be made in this chapter to a limited number, including those
  which from frequent usage have obtained a recognised heraldic character.
  Mention may, at the outset, be made of certain letters of the
  <i>alphabet</i>. Instances of these are scarcely common, but the family
  of Kekitmore may be adduced as bearing "Gules, three S's or," while
  Bridlington Priory had for arms: "Per pale, sable and argent, three B's
  counterchanged." The arms of Rashleigh are: "Sable, a cross or, between
  in the first quarter a Cornish chough argent, beaked and legged gules; in
  the second a text <b>T</b>; in the third and fourth a crescent all
  argent." Corporate arms (in England) afford an instance of alphabetical
  letters in the case of the <b>B</b>'s on the shield of Bermondsey.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig498.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig498.png"
      alt="Fig. 498." title="Fig. 498." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    498.</span>&mdash;Anchor.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Anchor</i> (Fig. 498).&mdash;This charge figures very largely
  in English armory, as may, perhaps, be looked for when it is remembered
  that maritime devices occur more frequently in sea-board lands than in
  continents. The arms of the town of Musselburgh are: "Azure, three
  anchors in pale, one in the chief and two in the flanks or, accompanied
  with as many mussels, one in the dexter and one in the sinister chief
  points, and the third in base proper." The Comtes de St. Cricq, with
  "Argent, two anchors in saltire sable, on a chief three mullets or," will
  be an instance in point as to France.</p>

  <p><i>Anvils.</i>&mdash;These are occasionally met with, as in the case
  of the arms of a family of the name of Walker, who bear: "Argent, on a
  chevron gules, between two anvils in chief and an anchor in base sable, a
  bee between two crescents or. Mantling gules and argent. <!-- Page 282
  --><span class="pagenum" title="320.png"><a
  name="page282"></a>{282}</span>Crest: upon a wreath of the colours, on a
  mount within a wreathed serpent a dove all statant proper."</p>

  <p>Arches, castles, towers, and turrets may be exemplified, amongst
  others, by the following.</p>

  <p>Instances of <i>Castles</i> and <i>Towers</i> will be found in the
  arms of Carlyon and Kelly, and of the former fractured castles will be
  found in the shield of Willoughby quartered by Bertie; while an example
  of a quadrangular castle may be seen in the arms of Rawson. The
  difference between a Castle (Fig. 499) and a Tower (Fig. 500) should be
  carefully noticed, and though it is a distinction but little observed in
  ancient days it is now always adhered to. When either castle or tower is
  surmounted by smaller towers (as Fig. 501) it is termed
  "triple-towered."</p>

  <p>An instance of a <i>Fortification</i> as a charge occurs in the shield
  of Sconce: "Azure, a fortification (sconce) argent, masoned sable, in the
  dexter chief point a mullet of six points of the second."</p>

  <p><i>Gabions</i> were hampers filled with earth, and were used in the
  construction of fortifications and earthworks. They are of occasional
  occurrence in English armory at any rate, and may be seen in the shields
  of Christie and of Goodfellow.</p>

  <p>The arms of Banks supply an instance of <i>Arches</i>. Mention may
  here perhaps be made of William Arches, who bore at the siege of Rouen:
  "Gules, three double arches argent." The family of Lethbridge bear a
  bridge, and this charge figures in a number of other coats.</p>

  <p><i>An Abbey</i> occurs in the arms of Maitland of Dundrennan ["Argent,
  the ruins of an old abbey on a piece of ground all proper"], and a
  monastery in that of McLarty ["Azure, the front of an ancient monastery
  argent"]. A somewhat isolated instance of a <i>Temple</i> occurs in the
  shield of Templer.</p>

  <p>A curious canting grant of arms may be seen in that to the town of
  Eccles, in which the charge is an <i>Ecclesiastical Building</i>, and
  similar <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum" title="321.png"><a
  name="page283"></a>{283}</span>though somewhat unusual charges figure
  also in the quartering for Chappel ["Per chevron or and azure, in chief a
  mullet of six points between two crosses patée of the last, and in base
  the front elevation of a chapel argent"], borne by Brown-Westhead.</p>

  <p><i>Arrows</i> are very frequently found, and the arms of Hales supply
  one of the many examples of this charge, while a bow&mdash;without the
  arrows&mdash;may be instanced in the shield of Bowes: "Ermine, three bows
  bent and stringed palewise in fess proper."</p>

  <p><i>Arrow-Heads</i> and <i>Pheons</i> are of common usage, and occur in
  the arms of Foster and many other families. Pheons, it may be noticed in
  passing, are arrow-heads with an inner engrailed edge (Fig. 502), while
  when depicted without this peculiarity they are termed "broad arrows"
  (Fig. 503). This is not a distinction very stringently adhered to.</p>

  <p>Charges associated with warfare and military defences are frequently
  to be found both in English and foreign heraldry.</p>

  <p><i>Battle-Axes</i> (Fig. 504), for example, may be seen in the shield
  of Firth and in that of Renty in Artois, which has: "Argent, three
  doloires, or broad-axes, gules, those in chief addorsed." In blazoning a
  battle-axe care should be taken to specify the fact if the head is of a
  different colour, as is frequently the case.</p>

  <p>The somewhat infrequent device of a <i>Battering-Ram</i> is seen in
  the arms of Bertie, who bore: "Argent, three battering-rams fesswise in
  pale proper, armed and garnished azure."</p>

  <p>An instrument of military defence consisting of an iron frame of four
  points, and called a <i>Caltrap</i> (Fig. 505) or <i>Galtrap</i> (and
  sometimes a Cheval trap, from its use of impeding the approach of
  cavalry), is found in the arms of Trappe ["Argent, three caltraps
  sable"], Gilstrap and other families; while French armory supplies us
  with another example in <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum" title="322.png"
  ><a name="page284"></a>{284}</span>the case of the family of Guetteville
  de Guénonville, who bore for arms: "D'argent, semée de chausse-trapes de
  sable." Caltraps are also strewn upon the compartment upon which the
  supporters to the arms of the Earl of Perth are placed.</p>

  <p>As the well-known badge of the Royal House of Tudor, the
  <i>Portcullis</i> (Fig. 506) is familiar to any one conversant with Henry
  VII.'s Chapel at Westminster Abbey, but it also appears as a charge in
  the arms of the family of Wingate ["Gules, a portcullis and a chief
  embattled or"], where it forms an obvious pun on the earliest form of the
  name, viz. Windygate, whilst it figures also as the crest of the Dukes of
  Beaufort ["A portcullis or, nailed azure, chained of the first"]. The
  disposition of the chains is a matter always left to the discretion of
  the artist.</p>

  <p>Examples of <i>Beacons</i> (Fig. 507) are furnished by the
  achievements of the family of Compton and of the town of Wolverhampton. A
  <i>fire chest</i> occurs in the arms of Critchett (<i>vide</i> p. <a
  href="#page261">261</a>).</p>

  <p><i>Chains</i> are singularly scarce in armory, and indeed nearly
  wholly absent as <i>charges</i>, usually occurring where they do as part
  of the crest. The English shield of Anderton, it is true, bears: "Sable,
  three chains argent;" while another one (Duppa de Uphaugh) has:
  "Quarterly, 1 and 4, a lion's paw couped in fess between two chains or, a
  chief nebuly of the last, thereon two roses of the first, barbed and
  seeded proper (for Duppa); 2 and 3, party fess azure and sable, a trident
  fesswise or, between three turbots argent (for Turbutt)." In Continental
  heraldry, however, chains are more frequently met with. Principal amongst
  these cases maybe cited the arms of Navarre ("Gules, a cross saltire and
  double orle of chains, linked together or"), while many other instances
  are found in the armories of Southern France and of Spain.</p>

  <p><i>Bombs</i> or <i>Grenades</i> (Fig. 508), for Heraldry does not
  distinguish, figure in the shields of Vavasseur, Jervoise, Boycott, and
  many other families. <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum" title="323.png"
  ><a name="page285"></a>{285}</span></p>

  <p>Among the more recent grants <i>Cannon</i> have figured, as in the
  case of the Pilter arms and in those of the burgh of Portobello; while an
  earlier counterpart, in the form of a culverin, forms the charge of the
  Leigh family: "Argent, a culverin in fess sable."</p>

  <p>The <i>Column</i> appears as a crest in the achievement of Coles.
  Between two cross crosslets it occurs in the arms of Adam of Maryburgh
  ["Vert, a Corinthian column with capital and base in pale proper, between
  two cross crosslets fitchée in fess or"], while the arms of the See of
  Sodor and Man are blazoned: "Argent, upon a pedestal the Virgin Mary with
  her arms extended between two pillars, in the dexter hand a church
  proper, in base the arms of Man in an escutcheon." Major, of Suffolk,
  bears: "Azure, three Corinthian columns, each surmounted by a ball, two
  and one argent." It is necessary to specify the kind of column in the
  blazon.</p>

  <p><i>Scaling-Ladders</i> (Fig. 509) (viz. ordinary-shaped ladders with
  grapnels affixed to the tops) are to be seen in the English coats of
  D'Urban and Lloyd, while the Veronese Princes della Scala bore the
  ordinary ladder: "Gules, a ladder of four steps in pale argent." A
  further instance of this form of the charge occurs in the Swiss shield of
  Laiterberg: "Argent, two ladders in saltire gules."</p>

  <p><i>Spears</i> and <i>Spear-Heads</i> are to be found in the arms of
  many families both in England, Wales, and abroad; for example, in the
  arms of Amherst and Edwards. Distinction must be drawn between the lance
  or javelin (Fig. 510) and the heraldic tilting-spear (Fig. 511),
  particularly as the latter is always depicted with the sharp point for
  warfare instead of the blunted point which was actually used in the
  tournament. The Shakespeare arms (Fig. 512) are: "Or, on a bend sable a
  tilting-spear of the field," while "Azure, a lance or enfiled <!-- Page
  286 --><span class="pagenum" title="324.png"><a
  name="page286"></a>{286}</span>at its point by an annulet argent"
  represents the French family of Danby.</p>

  <p><i>Spurs</i> (Fig. 513) occur in coat armour as such in the arms of
  Knight and Harben, and also occasionally "winged" (Fig. 514), as in the
  crest of Johnston.</p>

  <p><i>Spur-Rowels</i>, or <i>Spur-Revels</i>, are to be met with under
  that name, but they are, and are more often termed, "mullets of five
  points pierced."</p>

  <p>Examples of <i>Stirrups</i> are but infrequent, and the best-known one
  (as regards English armory) is that of Scudamore, while the Polish Counts
  Brzostowski bore: "Gules, a stirrup argent, within a bordure or."</p>

  <p><i>Stones</i> are even more rare, though a solitary example may be
  quoted in the arms of Staniland: Per pale or and vert, a pale
  counterchanged, three eagles displayed two and one, and as many
  flint-stones one and two all proper. The "vigilance" of the crane has
  been already alluded to on page <a href="#page247">247</a>. The mention
  of stones brings one to the kindred subject of <i>Catapults</i>. These
  engines of war, needless to say on a very much larger scale than the
  object which is nowadays associated with the term, were also known by the
  name <i>balistæ</i>, and also by that of <i>swepe</i>. Their occurrence
  is very infrequent, but for that very reason one may, perhaps, draw
  attention to the arms of the (English) family of Magnall: "Argent, a
  swepe azure, charged with a stone or."</p>

  <p><i>Swords</i>, differing in number, position, and kind are, perhaps,
  of this class of charge the most numerous. A single sword as a charge may
  be seen in the shield of Dick of Wicklow, and Macfie, and a sword
  entwined by a serpent in that of Mackesy. A flaming sword occurs in the
  arms of Maddocks and Lewis. Swords frequently figure, too, in the hands
  or paws of supporters, accordingly as the latter are human figures or
  animals, whilst they figure as the "supporters" themselves in the unique
  case of the French family of Bastard, whose shield is cottised by "two
  swords, point in base." The heraldic sword is represented as Fig. 515,
  the blade of the <i>dagger</i> <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum" title="325.png"
  ><a name="page287"></a>{287}</span>being shorter and more pointed. The
  <i>scymitar</i> follows the form depicted in Fig. 516.</p>

  <p>A <i>Seax</i> is the term employed to denote a curved scimitar, or
  falchion, having a notch at the back of the blade (Fig. 517). In heraldry
  the use of this last is fairly frequent, though generally, it must be
  added, in shields of arms of doubtful authority. As such they are to be
  seen, amongst others, in the reputed arms of Middlesex, and owing to this
  origin they were included in the grant of arms to the town of Ealing. The
  sabre and the cutlass when so blazoned follow their utilitarian
  patterns.</p>

  <p><i>Torches</i> or <i>Firebrands</i> are depicted in the arms and crest
  of Gillman and Tyson.</p>

  <p><i>Barnacles</i> (or <i>Breys</i>)&mdash;horse curbs&mdash;occur in
  some of the earlier coats, as in the arms of Wyatt ["Gules, a barnacle
  argent"], while another family of the same name (or, possibly, Wyot)
  bore: "Per fess gules and azure (one or) three barnacles argent".</p>

  <p><i>Bells</i> are well instanced in the shield of Porter, and the poet
  Wordsworth bore: "Argent, three bells azure." It may be noted in passing
  that in Continental armory the clapper is frequently of a different
  tincture to that of the bell, as, for instance, "D'Azure, à la cloche
  d'argent, butaillé [viz. with the clapper] de sable"&mdash;the arms of
  the Comtes de Bellegarse. A bell is assumed to be a church-bell (Fig.
  518) unless blazoned as a hawk's bell (Fig. 519).</p>

  <p><i>Bridle-Bits</i> are of very infrequent use, though they may be seen
  in the achievement of the family of Milner.</p>

  <p>The <i>Torse</i> (or wreath surmounting the helm) occasionally figures
  as a charge, for example, in the arms of Jocelyn and Joslin.</p>

  <p><i>The Buckle</i> is a charge which is of much more general use than
  some of the foregoing. It appears very frequently both in English <!--
  Page 288 --><span class="pagenum" title="326.png"><a
  name="page288"></a>{288}</span>and foreign heraldry&mdash;sometimes
  oval-shaped (Fig. 520), circular (Fig. 521), or square (Fig. 522), but
  more generally lozenge-shaped (Fig. 523), especially in the case of
  Continental arms. A somewhat curious variation occurs in the arms of the
  Prussian Counts Wallenrodt, which are: "Gules, a lozenge-shaped buckle
  argent, the tongue broken in the middle." It is, of course, purely an
  artistic detail in all these buckles whether the tongue is attached to a
  crossbar, as in Figs. 520 and 521, or not, as in Figs. 522 and 523. As a
  badge the buckle is used by the Pelhams, Earls of Chichester and Earls of
  Yarborough, and a lozenge-shaped arming buckle is the badge of
  Jerningham.</p>

  <p><i>Cups</i> (covered) appear in the Butler arms, and derived therefrom
  in the arms of the town of Warrington. Laurie, of Maxwelltown, bear:
  "Sable, a cup argent, issuing therefrom a garland between two
  laurel-branches all proper," and similar arms are registered in Ireland
  for Lowry. The Veronese family of Bicchieri bear: "Argent, a fess gules
  between three drinking-glasses half-filled with red wine proper." An
  uncovered cup occurs in the arms of Fox, derived by them from the crest
  of Croker, and another instance occurs in the arms of a family of Smith.
  In this connection we may note in passing the rare use of the device of a
  <i>Vase</i>, which forms a charge in the coat of the town of Burslem,
  whilst it is also to be met with in the crest of the family of Doulton:
  "On a wreath of the colours, a demi-lion sable, holding in the dexter paw
  a cross crosslet or, and resting the sinister upon an escutcheon charged
  with a vase proper." The motto is perhaps well worth recording; "Le beau
  est la splendeur de vrai."</p>

  <p><i>Chess-Rooks</i> (Fig. 524) are somewhat favourite heraldic devices,
  and are to be met with in a shield of Smith and the arms of Rocke of
  Clungunford.</p>

  <p>The <i>Crescent</i> (Fig. 525) figures largely in all armories, both
  as a charge and (in English heraldry) as a difference.</p>

  <p>Variations, too, of the form of the crescent occur, such as when the
  horns are turned to the dexter (Fig. 526), when it is termed "a crescent
  increscent," or simply "an increscent," or when they are turned to the
  sinister&mdash;when it is styled "decrescent" (Fig. 527). An instance of
  the crescent "reversed" may be seen in the shield of the Austrian family
  of Puckberg, whose blazon was: "Azure, three crescents, those in chief
  addorsed, that in base reversed." In English "difference marks" the
  crescent is used to denote the second son, but under this character it
  will be discussed later.</p>

  <p>Independently of its use in conjunction with ecclesiastical armory,
  the <i>Crosier</i> (Fig. 528) is not widely used in ordinary
  achievements. It does occur, however, as a principal charge, as in the
  arms of the Irish family of Crozier and in the arms of Benoit (in
  Dauphiny) ["Gules, a pastoral staff argent"], while it forms part of the
  crest of Alford. The term "crosier" is synonymous with the pastoral or
  episcopal staff, and is independent of the cross which is borne
  <i>before</i> (and not <i>by</i>) <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum" title="330.png"
  ><a name="page290"></a>{290}</span>Archbishops and Metropolitans. The use
  of pastoral staves as charges is also to be seen in the shield of Were,
  while MacLaurin of Dreghorn bears: "Argent, a shepherd's crook sable."
  The <i>Palmer's Staff</i> (Fig. 529) has been introduced into many coats
  of arms for families having the surname of Palmer, as has also the
  palmer's wallet.</p>

  <p><i>Cushions</i>, somewhat strangely, form the charges in a number of
  British shields, occurring, for example, in the arms of Brisbane, and on
  the shield of the Johnstone family. In Scottish heraldry, indeed,
  cushions appear to have been of very ancient (and general) use, and are
  frequently to be met with. The Earls of Moray bore: "Argent, three
  cushions lozengewise within a double tressure flory-counterflory gules,"
  but an English example occurs in the arms of Hutton.</p>

  <p><i>The Distaff</i>, which is supposed to be the origin of the lozenge
  upon which a lady bears her arms, is seldom seen in heraldry, but the
  family of Body, for instance, bear one in chief, and three occur in the
  arms of a family of Lees.</p>

  <p><i>The Shuttle</i> (Fig. 530) occurs in the arms of Shuttleworth, and
  in those of the town of Leigh, while the shield of the borough of Pudsey
  affords an illustration of shuttles in conjunction with a woolpack (Fig.
  531).</p>

  <p><i>The Escarbuncle</i> (Fig. 532) is an instance of a charge having so
  developed by the evolution of an integral part of the shield itself. In
  <!-- Page 291 --><span class="pagenum" title="331.png"><a
  name="page291"></a>{291}</span>ancient warfare shields were sometimes
  strengthened by being bound with iron bands radiating from the centre,
  and these bands, from the shape they assumed, became in course of time a
  charge in themselves under the term escarbuncle.</p>

  <p>The crest of the Fanmakers' Company is: "A hand couped proper holding
  a <i>fan</i> displayed," while the chief charge in the arms is "... a fan
  displayed ... the sticks gules." This, however, is the only case I can
  cite of this object.</p>

  <p>The <i>Fasces</i> (Fig. 533), emblematic of the Roman magisterial
  office, is very frequently introduced in grants of arms to Mayors and
  Lord Mayors, which no doubt accounts for its appearance in the arms of
  Durning-Lawrence, Knill, Evans, and Spokes.</p>

  <p>An instance of <i>Fetterlocks</i> (Fig. 534) occurs in the arms of
  Kirkwood, and also in the coat of Lockhart and the crest of Wyndham. A
  chain is often substituted for the bow of the lock. The modern padlock
  has been introduced into the grant of arms to the town of
  Wolverhampton.</p>

  <p><i>Keys</i>, the emblem of St. Peter, and, as such, part of the
  insignia of His Holiness the Pope, occur in many ecclesiastical coats,
  the arms of the Fishmongers' Livery Company, and many families.</p>

  <p><i>Flames of Fire</i> are not frequently met with, but they are to be
  found in the arms of Baikie, and as crests they figure in the
  achievements of Graham-Wigan, and also in conjunction with keys in that
  of Flavel. In connection with certain other objects flames are common
  enough. The ph&oelig;nix always issues from flames, and a salamander is
  always in the midst of flames (Fig. 437). The flaming sword, a device, by
  the way, included in the recent grant to Sir George Lewis, Bart., has
  been already alluded to, as has also the flaming brand. A notable example
  of the torch occurs in the crest of Sir William Gull, Bart., no doubt an
  allusion (as is his augmentation) to the skill by which he kept the torch
  of life burning in the then Prince of Wales during his serious illness in
  1871. A flaming mountain occurs as the crest of several families of the
  name of Grant. <!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum" title="332.png"><a

  <p>A curious instrument now known nearly exclusively in connection with
  its use by farriers, and termed a <i>Fleam</i> (Fig. 535), occurs on the
  chief of the shield of Moore. A fleam, however, is the ancient form and
  name of a surgeon's lancet, and some connection with surgery may be
  presumed when it occurs. It is one of the charges in the arms recently
  granted to Sir Frederick Treves, Bart.</p>

  <p><i>Furison.</i>&mdash;This singular charge occurs in the shield of
  Black, and also in that of Steel. Furisons were apparently the
  instruments by which fire was struck from flint stones.</p>

  <p>Charges in connection with music and musical instruments do not occur
  very frequently, though the heraldic use of the <i>Clarion</i> (Fig. 536)
  and the <i>Harp</i> may perhaps be mentioned. The bugle-horn (Fig. 537)
  also occurs "stringed" (Fig. 538), and when the bands round it are of a
  different colour it is termed "veruled" or "virolled" of that colour.</p>

  <p><i>The Human Heart</i>, which should perhaps have been more correctly
  referred to in an earlier chapter, is a charge which is well known in
  heraldry, both English and foreign. Perhaps the best known examples of
  the heart ensigned with a crown is seen in the shields of Douglas and
  Johnstone. The legend which accounts for the appearance of this charge in
  the arms of Douglas is too well known to need repetition.</p>

  <p><i>Ingots of silver</i> occur in the shield of the borough of St.
  Helens, whilst the family of Woollan go one better by bearing ingots of
  gold.</p>

  <p><i>A Maunch</i> (Fig. 539), which is a well-known heraldic term for
  the sleeve, is, as it is drawn, scarcely recognisable as such.
  Nevertheless its evolution can be clearly traced. The maunch&mdash;which,
  of course, as a heraldic charge, originated in the knightly "favour" of a
  lady's sleeve&mdash;was borne from the earliest periods in different
  tinctures by the three historic families of Conyers, Hastings, and
  Wharton. Other garments have been used as heraldic charges; gloves in the
  arms of <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum" title="333.png"><a
  name="page293"></a>{293}</span>Fletcher and Barttelot; stockings in the
  arms of Hose; a boot in the crest of Hussy, and a hat in the arms of
  Huth. Armour is frequently met with, a cuirass appearing in the crest of
  Somers, helmets in the arms of Salvesen, Trayner, Roberton, and many
  other families, gauntlets (Fig. 540), which need to be specified as
  dexter or sinister, in the arms of Vane and the crest of Burton, and a
  morion (Fig. 541) in the crest of Pixley. The Garter is, of course, due
  to that Order of knighthood; and the Blue Mantle of the same Order,
  besides giving his title to one of the Pursuivants of Arms, who uses it
  as his badge, has also been used as a charge.</p>

  <p><i>The Mill-rind</i> or <i>Fer-de-moline</i> is, of course, as its
  name implies, the iron from the centre of a grindstone. It is depicted in
  varying forms, more or less recognisable as the real thing (Fig.
  542).</p>

  <p><i>Mirrors</i> occur almost exclusively in crests and in connection
  with mermaids, who, as a general rule, are represented as holding one in
  the dexter hand with a comb in the sinister. Very occasionally, however,
  mirrors appear as charges, an example being that of the Counts Spiegel
  zum Desenberg, who bore: "Gules, three round mirrors argent in square
  frames or."</p>

  of Barrow-in-Furness. The curious figure of the lion dimidiated with the
  hulk of a ship which is met with in the arms of several of the towns of
  the Cinque Ports has been referred to on page <a
  href="#page182">182</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Clouds</i> form part of the arms of Leeson, which are: "Gules, a
  chief nebuly argent, the rays of the sun issuing therefrom or."</p>

  <p>The <i>Rainbow</i> (Fig. 544), though not in itself a distinctly
  modern charge, for it occurs in the crest of Hope, has been of late very
  frequently granted as part of a crest. Instances occur in the crest of
  <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum" title="335.png"><a
  name="page295"></a>{295}</span>the family of Pontifex, and again in that
  of Thurston, and of Wigan. Its use as a part of a crest is to be
  deprecated, but in these days of complicated armory it might very
  advantageously be introduced as a charge upon a shield.</p>

  <p>An unusual device, the <i>Thunderbolt</i>, is the crest of Carnegy.
  The arms of the German family of Donnersperg very appropriately are:
  "Sable, three thunderbolts or issuing from a chief nebuly argent, in base
  a mount of three coupeaux of the second." The arms of the town of
  Blackpool furnish an instance of a thunderbolt in dangerous conjunction
  with windmill sails.</p>

  <p><i>Stars</i>, a very common charge, may be instanced as borne under
  that name by the Scottish shield of Alston. There has, owing to their
  similarity, been much confusion between <i>stars</i>, <i>estoiles</i>,
  <i>and mullets</i>. The difficulty is increased by the fact that no very
  definite lines have ever been followed officially. In England stars under
  that name are practically unknown. When the rays are wavy the charge is
  termed an estoile, but when they are straight the term mullet is used.
  That being so, these rules follow: that the estoile is never pierced (and
  from the accepted method of depicting the estoile this would hardly seem
  very feasible), and that unless the number of points is specified there
  will be six (see Fig. 545). Other numbers are quite permissible, but the
  number of points (more usually in an estoile termed "rays") must be
  stated. The arm of Hobart, for example, are: "Sable, an estoile of eight
  rays or, between two flaunches ermine." An estoile of sixteen rays is
  used by the town of Ilchester, but the arms are not of any authority.
  Everything with straight points being in England a mullet, it naturally
  follows that the English practice permits a mullet to be plain (Fig. 546)
  or pierced (Fig. 547). Mullets are occasionally met with pierced of a
  colour other than the field they are charged upon. According to the
  English practice, therefore, the mullet is not represented as pierced
  unless it is expressly stated to be so. The mullet both in England and
  <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum" title="336.png"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span>Scotland is of five points unless a
  greater number are specified. But mullets pierced and unpierced of six
  (Fig. 548) or eight points (Fig. 549) are frequent enough in English
  armory.</p>

  <p>The Scottish practice differs, and it must be admitted that it is more
  correct than the English, though, strange to say, more complicated. In
  Scottish armory they have the estoile, the star, and the mullet or the
  spur-revel. As to the estoile, of course, their practice is similar to
  the English. But in Scotland a straight-pointed charge is a mullet if it
  be pierced, and a star if it be not. As a mullet is really the "molette"
  or rowel of a spur, it certainly could not exist as a fact unpierced.
  Nevertheless it is by no means stringently adhered to in that country,
  and they make confusion worse confounded by the frequent use of the
  additional name of "spur-rowel," or "spur-revel" for the pierced mullet.
  The mullet occurs in the arms of Vere, and was also the badge of that
  family. The part this badge once played in history is well known. Had the
  De Veres worn another badge on that fatal day the course of English
  history might have been changed.</p>

  <p>The six-pointed mullet pierced occurs in the arms of De Clinton.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sun in Splendour</i>&mdash;(Fig. 550) always so
  blazoned&mdash;is never represented without the surrounding rays, but the
  human face is not essential though usual to its heraldic use. The rays
  are alternately straight and wavy, indicative of the light and heat we
  derive therefrom, a typical piece of genuine symbolism. It is a charge in
  the arms of Hurst, Pearson, and many other families; and a demi-sun
  issuing in base occurs in the arms of Davies (Plate VI.) and of
  Westworth. The coat of Warde-Aldam affords an example of the <i>Rays</i>
  of the sun alone.</p>

  <p>A Scottish coat, that of Baillie of Walstoun, has "Azure, the moon in
  her complement, between nine mullets argent, three, two, three and one."
  The term "in her complement" signifies that the moon is full, but with
  the moon no rays are shown, in this of course differing from the sun in
  splendour. The face is usually represented in the full moon, <!-- Page
  297 --><span class="pagenum" title="337.png"><a
  name="page297"></a>{297}</span>and sometimes in the crescent moon, but
  the crescent moon must not be confused with the ordinary heraldic
  crescent.</p>

  <p>In concluding this class of charges, we may fitly do so by an allusion
  to the shield of Sir William Herschel, with its appropriate though clumsy
  device of a <i>Telescope</i>.</p>

  <p>As may be naturally expected, the insignia of sovereignty are of very
  frequent occurrence in all armories, both English and foreign. Long
  before the days of heraldry, some form of decoration for the head to
  indicate rank and power had been in vogue amongst, it is hardly too much
  to say, all nations on the earth. As in most things, Western nations have
  borrowed both ideas, and added developments of those ideas, from the
  East, and in traversing the range of armory, where crowns and coronets
  appear in modern Western heraldry, we find a large proportion of these
  devices are studiously and of purpose delineated as being
  <i>Eastern</i>.</p>

  <p>With crowns and coronets as symbols of rank I am not now, of course,
  concerned, but only with those cases which may be cited as supplying
  examples where the different kinds of crowns appear either as charges on
  shields, or as forming parts of crests.</p>

  <p>Crowns, in heraldry, may be differentiated under the Royal or the
  Imperial, the Eastern or antique, the Naval, and the Mural, which with
  the Crowns Celestial, Vallery and Palisado are all known as charges.
  Modern grants of crowns of Eastern character in connection with valuable
  service performed in the East by the recipient may be instanced;
  <i>e.g.</i> by the Eastern Crown in the grant to Sir Abraham Roberts,
  G.C.B., the father of Field-Marshal Earl Roberts, K.G.</p>

  <p>In order of antiquity one may best perhaps at the outset allude to the
  arms borne by the seaport towns of Boston, and of Kingston-on-Hull (or
  Hull, as the town is usually called), inasmuch as a tradition has it that
  the three crowns which figure on the shield of each of these towns
  originate from a recognised device of merchantmen, who, travelling in and
  trading with the East and likening themselves to the Magi, in their
  Bethlehem visit, adopted these crowns as the device or badge of their
  business. The same remarks may apply to the arms of Cologne: "Argent, on
  a chief gules, three crowns or."</p>

  <p>From this fact (if the tradition be one) to the adoption of the same
  device by the towns to which these merchants traded is not a far
  step.</p>

  <p>One may notice in passing that, unlike what from the legend one would
  expect, these crowns are not of Eastern design, but of a class wholly
  connected with heraldry itself. The legend and device, however, are both
  much older than these modern minutiæ of detail.</p>

  <p>The Archbishopric of York has the well-known coat: "Gules, two keys in
  saltire argent, in chief a regal crown proper." <!-- Page 298 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="338.png"><a name="page298"></a>{298}</span></p>

  <p>The reputed arms of St. Etheldreda, who was both Queen, and also
  Abbess of Ely, find their perpetuation in the arms of that See, which
  are: "Gules, three ducal (an early form of the Royal) crowns or;" while
  the recently-created See of St. Alban's affords an example of a celestial
  crown: "Azure, a saltire or, a sword in pale proper; in chief a celestial
  crown of the second." The <i>Celestial Crown</i> is to be observed in the
  arms of the borough of Kensington and as a part of the crest of Dunbar.
  The See of Bristol bears: "Sable, three open crowns in pale or." The
  Royal or Imperial Crown occurs in the crest of Eye, while an <i>Imperial
  Crown</i> occurs in the crests of Robertson, Wolfe, and Lane.</p>

  <p>The family of Douglas affords an instance of a crown ensigning a human
  heart. The arms of Toledo afford another case in point, being: "Azure, a
  Royal crown or" (the cap being gules).</p>

  <p><i>Antique Crowns</i>&mdash;as such&mdash;appear in the arms of Fraser
  and also in the arms of Grant.</p>

  <p>The crest of the Marquess of Ripon supplies an unusual variation,
  inasmuch as it issues from a coronet composed of fleurs-de-lis.</p>

  <p>The other chief emblem of sovereignty&mdash;<i>the
  Sceptre</i>&mdash;is occasionally met with, as in the Whitgreave crest of
  augmentation.</p>

  <p>The Marquises of Mun bear the Imperial orb: "Azure, an orb argent,
  banded, and surmounted by the cross or." The reason for the selection of
  this particular charge in the grant of arms [Azure, on a fess or, a horse
  courant gules, between three orbs gold, banded of the third] to Sir H. E.
  Moss, of the Empire Theatre in Edinburgh and the London Hippodrome, will
  be readily guessed.</p>

  <p>Under the classification of tools and implements the <i>Pick</i> may
  be noted, this being depicted in the arms of Mawdsley, Moseley, and
  Pigott, and a pick and shovel in the arms of Hales.</p>

  <p>The arms of Crawshay supply an instance of a <i>Plough</i>&mdash;a
  charge which also occurs in the arms of Waterlow and the crest of
  Provand, but is otherwise of very infrequent occurrence.</p>

  <p>In English armory the use of <i>Scythes</i>, or, as they are sometimes
  termed, <i>Sneds</i>, is but occasional, though, as was only to be
  expected, this device appears in the Sneyd coat, as follows: "Argent, a
  scythe, the blade in chief, the sned in bend sinister sable, in the fess
  point a fleur-de-lis of the second." In Poland the Counts Jezierski bore:
  "Gules, two scythe-blades in oval, the points crossing each other argent,
  and the ends in base tied together or, the whole surmounted in chief by a
  cross-patriarchal-patée, of which the lower arm on the sinister side is
  wanting."</p>

  <p>Two sickles appear in the arms of Shearer, while the Hungerford crest
  in the case of the Holdich-Hungerford family is blazoned: <!-- Page 299
  --><span class="pagenum" title="339.png"><a
  name="page299"></a>{299}</span>"Out of a ducal coronet or, a pepper garb
  of the first between two sickles erect proper." The sickle was the badge
  of the Hungerfords.</p>

  <p>A <i>Balance</i> forms one of the charges of the Scottish Corporation
  of the Dean and Faculty of Advocates: "Gules, a balance or, and a sword
  argent in saltire, surmounted of an escutcheon of the second, charged
  with a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counterflory of the
  first," but it is a charge of infrequent appearance. It also figures in
  the arms of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</p>

  <p><i>Books</i> are frequently made use of. The arms of Rylands, the
  family to whose generosity Manchester owes the Rylands Library, afford a
  case in point, and such charges occur in the arms of the Universities of
  both Oxford and Cambridge, and in many other university and collegiate
  achievements.</p>

  <p><i>Buckets</i> and <i>Water-bougets</i> (Fig. 551) can claim a wide
  use. In English armory Pemberton has three buckets, and water-bougets
  appear in the well-known arms of Bourchier (Fig. 552). Water-bougets,
  which are really the old form of water-bucket, were leather bags or
  bottles, two of which were carried on a stick over the shoulder. The
  heraldic water-bouget represents the pair.</p>

  <p>For an instance of the heraldic usage of the <i>Comb</i> the case of
  the arms of Ponsonby, Earls of Bessborough, may be cited. Combs also
  figure in the delightfully punning Scottish coat for Rocheid.</p>

  <p>Generally, however, when they do occur in heraldry they represent
  combs for carding wool, as in the shield of Tunstall: "Sable, three
  wool-combs argent," while the Russian Counts Anrep-Elmpt use: "Or, a comb
  in bend azure, the teeth downwards."</p>

  <p><i>Escallops</i> (Fig. 553) rank as one of the most widely used
  heraldic charges in all countries. They figured in early days outside the
  limits of heraldry as the badge of pilgrims going to the Holy Land, and
  may <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum" title="340.png"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>be seen on the shields of many families at
  the period of the Crusades. Many other families have adopted them, in the
  hope of a similar interpretation being applied to the appearance of them
  in their own arms. Indeed, so numerous are the cases in which they occur
  that a few representative ones must suffice.</p>

  <p>They will be found in the arms of the Lords Dacre, who bore: "Gules,

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XX</h5>

<h5>THE HERALDIC HELMET</h5>

  <p>Since one's earliest lessons in the rules of heraldry, we have been
  taught, as one of the fundamental laws of the achievement, that the
  helmet by its shape and position is indicative of rank; and we early
  learnt by rote that the esquire's helmet was of steel, and was placed in
  profile, with the visor closed: the helmet of the knight and baronet was
  to be open and affronté; that the helmet of the peer must be of silver,
  guarded by grilles and placed in profile; and that the royal helmet was
  of gold, with grilles, and affronté. Until recent years certain
  stereotyped forms of the helmet for these varying circumstances were in
  use, hideous alike both in the regularity of their usage and the
  atrocious shapes into which they had been evolved. These regulations,
  like some other adjuncts of heraldic art, are comparatively speaking of
  modern origin. Heraldry in its earlier and better days knew them not, and
  they came into vogue about the Stuart times, when heraldic art was
  distinctly on the wane. It is puzzling to conceive a desire to stereotype
  these particular forms, and we take it that the fact, which is undoubted,
  arose from the lack of heraldic knowledge on the part of the artists,
  who, having one form before them, which they were assured was correct,
  under the circumstances simply reproduced this particular form in
  facsimile time after time, not knowing how far they might deviate and
  still remain correct. The knowledge of heraldry by the heraldic artist
  was the real point underlying the excellence of mediæval heraldic art,
  and underlying the excellence of much of the heraldic art in the revival
  of the last few years. As it has been often pointed out, in olden times
  they "played" with heraldry, and therein lay the excellence of that
  period. The old men knew the lines within which they could "play," and
  knew the laws which they could not transgress. Their successors, ignorant
  of the laws of arms, and afraid of the hidden meanings of armory, had
  none but the stereotyped lines to follow. The result was bad. Let us

  <p>To the modern mind, which grumbles at the weight of present-day <!--
  Page 304 --><span class="pagenum" title="344.png"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>head coverings, it is often a matter of
  great wonder how the knights of ancient days managed to put up with the
  heavy weight of the great iron helmet, with its wooden or leather crest.
  A careful study of ancient descriptions of tournaments and warfare will
  supply the clue to the explanation, which is simply that the helmet was
  very seldom worn. For ceremonial purposes and occasions it was carried by
  a page, and in actual use it was carried slung at the saddle-bow, until
  the last moment, when it was donned for action as blows and close contact
  became imminent. Then, by the nature of its construction, the weight was
  carried by the shoulders, the head and neck moving freely within
  necessary limits inside. All this will be more readily apparent, when the
  helmet itself is considered. Our present-day ideas of helmets&mdash;their
  shape, their size, and their proportions&mdash;are largely taken from the
  specimens manufactured (not necessarily in modern times) for ceremonial
  purposes; <i>e.g.</i> for exhibition as insignia of knighthood. By far
  the larger proportion of the genuine helmets now to be seen were
  purposely made (certainly at remote dates) not for actual use in battle
  or tournament, but for ceremonial use, chiefly at funerals. Few, indeed,
  are the examples still existing of helmets which have been actually used
  in battle or tournament. Why there are so few remaining to us, when every
  person of position must necessarily have possessed one throughout the
  Plantagenet period, and probably at any rate to the end of the reign of
  Henry VII., is a mystery which has puzzled many people&mdash;for helmets
  are not, like glass and china, subject to the vicissitudes of breakage.
  The reason is doubtless to be found in the fact that at that period they
  were so general, and so little out of the common, that they possessed no
  greater value than any other article of clothing; and whilst the real
  helmet, lacking a ceremonial value, was not preserved, the sham
  ceremonial helmet of a later period, possessing none but a ceremonial
  value, was preserved from ceremonial to ceremonial, and has been passed
  on to the present day. But a glance at so many of these helmets which
  exist will plainly show that it was quite impossible for any man's head
  to have gone inside them, and the sculptured helmets of what may seem to
  us uncouth shape and exaggerated size, which are occasionally to be found
  as part of a monumental effigy, are the size and shape of the helmets
  that were worn in battle. This accounts for the much larger-sized helmets
  in proportion to the size of shield which will be found in heraldic
  emblazonments of the Plantagenet and Tudor periods. The artists of those
  periods were accustomed to the sight of real helmets, and knew and drew
  the real proportion which existed between the fighting helmet and the
  fighting shield. Artists of Stuart and Georgian days knew only the
  ceremonial helmet, and consequently adopted and stereotyped its
  impossible shape, <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum" title="345.png"
  ><a name="page305"></a>{305}</span>and equally impossible size. Victorian
  heraldic artists, ignorant alike of the actual and the ceremonial,
  reduced the size even further, and until the recent revulsion in heraldic
  art, with its reversion to older types, and its copying of older
  examples, the helmets of heraldry had reached the uttermost limits of
  absurdity.</p>

  <p>The recent revival of heraldry is due to men with accurate and
  extensive knowledge, and many recent examples of heraldic art well
  compare with ancient types. One happy result of this revival is a return
  to older and better types of the helmet. But it is little use discarding
  the "heraldic" helmet of the stationer's shop unless a better and more
  accurate result can be shown, so that it will be well to trace in detail
  the progress of the real helmet from earliest times.</p>

  <p>In the Anglo-Saxon period the common helmet was merely a cap of
  leather, often four-cornered, and with a serrated comb (Figs. 560 and
  561), but men of rank had a conical one of metal (Fig. 562), which was
  frequently richly gilt. About the time of Edward the Confessor a small
  piece, of varying breadth, called a "nasal," was added (Fig. 563), which,
  with a quilted or gamboised hood, or one of mail, well protected the
  face, leaving little more than the eyes exposed; and in this form the
  helmet continued in general use until towards the end of the twelfth
  century, when we find it merged into or supplanted by the <!-- Page 306
  --><span class="pagenum" title="346.png"><a
  name="page306"></a>{306}</span>"chapelle-de-fer," which is first
  mentioned in documents at this period, and was shaped like a flat-topped,
  cylindrical cap. This, however, was soon enlarged so as to cover the
  whole head (Fig. 564), an opening being left for the features, which were
  sometimes protected by a movable "ventaille," or a visor, instead of the
  "nasal." This helmet (which was adopted by Richard I., who is also
  sometimes represented with a conical one) was the earliest form of the
  large war and tilting "heaume" (or helm), which was of great weight and
  strength, and often had only small openings or slits for the eyes (Figs.
  565 and 566). These eyepieces were either one wide slit or two, one on
  either side. The former was, however, sometimes divided into two by an
  ornamental bar or buckle placed across. It was afterwards pointed at the
  top, and otherwise slightly varied in shape, but its general form appears
  to have been the same until the end of the fourteenth century (Figs. 567,
  568). This type of helmet is usually known as the "pot-shaped." The
  helmets themselves were sometimes painted, and Fig. 569 represents an
  instance which is painted in green and white diagonal stripes. The
  illustration is from a parchment MS. of about 1241 now in the Town
  Library of Leipzic. Fig. 570 shows another German example of this type,
  being taken from the <i>Eneit</i> of Heinrich von Veldeke, a MS. now in
  the Royal Library in Berlin, belonging to the end of the twelfth century.
  The crest depicted in this case, a red lion, must be one of the earliest
  instances of a crest. These <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum" title="347.png"
  ><a name="page307"></a>{307}</span>are the helmets which we find on early
  seals and effigies, as will be seen from Figs. 571-574.</p>

  <p>The cylindrical or "pot-shaped" helmet of the Plantagenets, however,
  disappears in the latter part of the thirteenth century, when we first
  find mention of the "bascinet" (from Old French for a basin), Figs.
  575-579. This was at first merely a hemispherical steel cap, put over the
  coif of mail to protect the top of the head, when the knight wished to be
  relieved from the weight of his large helm (which he then slung at his
  back or carried on his saddlebow), but still did not consider the mail
  coif sufficient protection. It soon became pointed at the top, and
  gradually lower at the back, though not so much as to protect the neck.
  In the fourteenth century the mail, instead of being carried over the top
  of the head, was hung to the bottom rim of the helmet, and <!-- Page 308
  --><span class="pagenum" title="348.png"><a
  name="page308"></a>{308}</span>spread out over the shoulders, overlapping
  the cuirass. This was called the "camail," or "curtain of mail." It is
  shown in Figs. 576 and 577 fastened to the bascinet by a lace or thong
  passing through staples.</p>

  <p>The large helm, which throughout the fourteenth century was still worn
  over the bascinet, did not fit down closely to the cuirass (though it may
  have been fastened to it with a leather strap), its bottom curve not
  being sufficiently arched for that purpose; nor did it wholly rest on the
  shoulders, but was probably wadded inside so as to fit closely to the
  bascinet.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful if any actual helm previous to the fourteenth century
  exists, and there are very few of that period remaining. In that of the
  Black Prince at Canterbury (Fig. 271) the lower, or cylindrical, portion
  is composed of a front and back piece, riveted together at the sides, and
  this was most likely the usual form of construction; but in the helm of
  Sir Richard Pembridge (Figs. 580 and 581) the three pieces (cylinder,
  conical piece, and top piece) of which it is formed are fixed with nails,
  and are so welded together that no trace of a join is visible. The edges
  of the metal, turned outwards round the ocularium, are very thick, and
  the bottom edge is rolled inwards over a thick wire, so as not to cut the
  surcoat. There are many twin holes in the helmet for the aiglets, by
  which the crest and lambrequin were attached, and in front, near the
  bottom, are two + shaped holes for the T bolt, which was fixed by a chain
  to the cuirass.</p>

  <p>The helm of Sir Richard Hawberk (Figs. 582 and 583), who died in 1417,
  is made of five pieces, and is very thick and heavy. It is much more like
  the later form adapted for jousting, and was probably only for use in the
  tilt-yard; but, although more firmly fixed to the cuirass than the
  earlier helm, it did not fit closely down to it, as all later helms
  did.</p>

  <p>Singularly few examples of the pot-helmet actually exist. The "Linz"
  example (Figs. 584 and 585), which is now in the <!-- Page 309 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="349.png"><a
  name="page309"></a>{309}</span>Francisco-Carolinum Museum at Linz, was
  dredged out of the Traun, and is unfortunately very much corroded by
  rust. The fastening-place for the crest, however, is well preserved. The
  example belongs to the first half of the fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>The so-called "Pranker-Helm" (Fig. 586), from the chapter of Seckau,
  now in the collection of armour in the Historical Court Museum at Vienna,
  and belonging to the middle of the fourteenth century, could only have
  been used for tournaments. It is made of four strong hammered sheets of
  iron 1-2 millimetres thick, with other strengthening plates laid on. The

  <p>The custom of wearing the large helm over the bascinet being clumsy
  and troublesome, many kinds of visor were invented, so as to dispense
  with the large helm, except for jousting, two of which are represented in
  Figs. 575 and 579. In the first a plate shaped somewhat to the nose was
  attached to the part of the camail which covered the mouth. This plate,
  and the mail mouth-guard, when not in use, hung downwards towards the
  breast; but when in use it was drawn up and attached to a staple or
  locket on the front of the bascinet. This fashion, however, does not
  appear to have been adopted in England, but was peculiar to Germany,
  Austria, &amp;c. None of these contrivances seem to have been very
  satisfactory, but towards the end of the fourteenth century the large and
  salient beaked visor was invented (Fig. 587). It was fixed to hinges at
  the sides of the bascinet with pins, and was removable at will. A high
  collar of steel was next added as a substitute for the camail. This form
  of helmet remained in use during the first half of the fifteenth century,
  and the large helm, which was only used for jousting, took a different
  form, or rather several different forms, which may be divided into three
  kinds. In this connection it should be remembered that the heavy jousting
  helmet to which the crest had relation was probably never used in actual
  warfare. The first was called a bascinet, and was used for combats on
  foot. It had an almost spherical crown-piece, and came right down to the
  cuirass, to which it was firmly fixed, and was, like all large helms of
  the fifteenth century, large enough for the wearer to move his head about
  freely inside. The helm of Sir Giles Capel (Fig. 588) is a good specimen
  of this class; it has a visor of great thickness, in which are a great
  number of holes, thus enabling the wearer to see in every direction. The
  "barbute," or ovoid bascinet, with a chin-piece riveted to it, was
  somewhat like this helm, and is often seen on the brasses of <!-- Page
  311 --><span class="pagenum" title="353.png"><a
  name="page311"></a>{311}</span>1430-1450; the chin-piece retaining the
  name of "barbute," after the bascinet had gone out of fashion.</p>

  <p>The second kind of large helm used in the fifteenth century was the
  "jousting-helm," which was of great strength, and firmly fixed to the
  cuirass. One from the Brocas Collection (Figs. 589 and 590, date about
  1500) is perhaps the grandest helm in existence. It is formed of three
  pieces of different thicknesses (the front piece being the thickest),
  which are fixed together with strong iron rivets with salient heads and
  thin brass caps soldered to them. The arrangements for fixing it in front
  and behind are very complete and curious.</p>

  <p>The manner in which the helmet was connected with the rest of the
  armour is shown in Fig. 591, which is a representation of a German suit
  of tilting armour of the period about 1480, now in the collection of
  armour at the Royal Museum in Vienna.</p>

  <p>Of the same character, but of a somewhat different shape, is the
  helmet (Fig. 592) of Sir John Gostwick, who died in 1541, which is now in
  Willington Church, Bedfordshire. The illustration here given is taken
  from the <i>Portfolio</i>, No. 33. The visor opening on the right side of
  the helmet is evidently taken from an Italian model.</p>

  <p>The third and last kind of helm was the "tournament helm," and was
  similar to the first kind, and also called a "bascinet"; but the visor
  was generally barred, or, instead of a movable visor, the bars were
  riveted on the helm, and sometimes the face was only protected by a sort
  of wire-work, like a fencing-mask. It was only used for the tourney or
  mêlée, when the weapons were the sword and mace.</p>

  <p>The "chapelle-de-fer," which was in use in the thirteenth, fourteenth,
  and fifteenth centuries, was a light iron head-piece, with a broad, flat
  brim, somewhat turned down. Fig. 593 represents one belonging to the <!--
  Page 312 --><span class="pagenum" title="354.png"><a
  name="page312"></a>{312}</span>end of the fifteenth century, which is one
  of the few remaining, and is delicately forged in one piece of thin, hard
  steel.</p>

  <p>During the fourteenth century a new kind of helmet arose, called in
  England the "sallad," or "sallet." The word appears to have two
  derivations, each of which was applied to a different form of head-piece.
  First, the Italian "celata" (Fig. 594), which seems originally to have
  been a modification of the bascinet. Second, the German "schallern," the
  form of which was probably suggested by the chapelle-de-fer. Both of
  these were called by the French "salade," whence our English "sallad."
  The celata came lower down than the bascinet, protected the back and
  sides of the neck, and, closing round the cheeks, often left only the
  eyes, nose, and mouth exposed. A standard of mail protected the neck if
  required. In the fifteenth century the celata ceased to be pointed at the
  summit, and was curved outwards at the nape of the neck, as in Fig.
  595.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 593.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>The "schallern" (from <i>shale</i>, a shell, or bowl), was really a
  helmet and visor in one piece; it had a slit for the eyes, a projecting
  brim, and a long tail, and was completed by a chin-piece, or "bavier"
  (Eng. "beaver"), which was strapped round the neck. Fig. 596 shows a
  German sallad and a Spanish beaver. The sallad was much used in the
  fifteenth century, during the latter half of which it often had a visor,
  as in one from Rhodes (Fig. 597), which has a spring catch on the right
  side to hold the visor in place when down. The rivets for its lining-cap
  have large, hollow, twisted heads, which are seldom found on existing
  sallads, though often seen in sculpture.</p>

  <p>The schale, schallern (<i>schêlern</i>), or sallad, either with or
  without a <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum" title="355.png"><a
  name="page313"></a>{313}</span>visor, is very seldom seen in heraldic
  use. An instance, however, in which it has been made use of heraldically
  will be found in Fig. 598, which is from a pen and ink drawing in the
  <i>Fest-Buch</i> of Paulus Kel, a MS. now in the Royal Library at Munich.
  This shows the schallern with the slit for seeing through, and the fixed
  neck-guard. The "bart," "bavière," or beaver, for the protection of the
  under part of the face, is also visible. It is not joined to the helmet.
  The helmet bears the crest of Bavaria, the red-crowned golden lion of the
  Palatinate within the wings of the curiously disposed Bavarian tinctures.
  Fig. 599 (p. 316) is a very good representation of a schallern dating
  from the latter part of the fifteenth century, with a sliding neck-guard.
  It is reproduced from the <i>Deutscher Herold</i>, 1892, No. 2.</p>

  <p>Until almost the middle of the fifteenth century all helmets fitted on
  the top of the head, or were put right over; but about 1440 the Italians
  made a great improvement by inventing the "armet," the lower part of
  which opened out with hinges, so that when put on it enclosed the head,
  fitting closely round the lower part of it, while its weight was borne by
  the steel collar, or "gorget." The Italian armet had a roundel or disc to
  protect the opening at the back of the neck, and a bavier strapped on in
  front to cover the joining of the two <!-- Page 314 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="356.png"><a
  name="page314"></a>{314}</span>cheek-pieces. The earlier armets, like the
  beaked bascinet, had a camail attached by a row of staples (Fig. 600),
  which was continued later, but then fixed either to a metal band or
  leather strap and riveted to the base of the armet. This form of helmet
  was not in common use in England until about 1500.</p>

  <p>Fig. 600 shows the earliest form of Italian armet, with a
  reinforcing-piece on the forehead, and a removable visor. Date 1450-1480.
  Fig. 601 represents an armet of very fine form (probably Italian), which
  is a nearer approach to the close-helmet of the sixteenth century, as the
  visor cannot be removed, and the eye-slit is in the visor, instead of
  being formed by the space between it and the crown-piece, and there is
  also no reinforcing-piece in the crown. Date 1480-1500. Fig. 602 is still
  more like the sixteenth-century helmet, for it opens down the sides
  instead of down the chin and back, and the same pivot which secures the
  visor also serves as a hinge for the crown and chin-piece. The small
  mentonnière, or bavier, is equal on both sides, but it was often of less
  extent on the right. Date about 1500.</p>

  <p>Fig. 603 shows a German fluted helmet, of magnificent form and
  workmanship, which is partly engraved and gilded. Date 1510-1525. It
  opens down the chin, like the early armets, but the tail-piece of the
  crown is much broader. The skill shown in the forging of the crown and
  the fluting of the twisted comb is most remarkable, and each rivet for
  the lining-strap of the cheek-pieces forms the centre of an engraved
  six-leaved rose. A grooved rim round the bottom of the helmet fitted
  closely on a salient rim at the top of the steel gorget or hause col, so
  that when placed on its gorget and closed, it could not be wrenched off,
  but could yet be moved round freely in a horizontal direction. The gorget
  being articulated, the head could also be raised or lowered a little, but
  not enough to make this form of joint very desirable, and a looser kind
  was soon substituted.</p>

  <p>Fig. 604 shows what is perhaps the most perfect type of close helmet.
  The comb is much larger than was the custom at an earlier date, and much
  resembles those of the morions of this period. The visor is formed of two
  separate parts; the upper fits inside the lower, and could be raised to
  facilitate seeing without unfixing the lower portion. It is engraved with
  arabesques, and is probably Italian. Date 1550-1570. Fig. 605 is an
  English helmet, half-way between a close helmet and a "burgonet." It is
  really a "casque," with cheek-pieces to meet in front. The crown-piece is
  joined down the middle of the comb. This helmet was probably made for the
  Earl of Leicester. Date about 1590.</p>

  <p>The word "burgonet" first appeared about the beginning of the
  fifteenth century, and described a form of helmet like the "celata," and
  <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum" title="357.png"><a
  name="page315"></a>{315}</span>called by that name in Italy. It was
  completed by a "buffe," or chin-piece, similar to the bavier.</p>

  <p>During this century the "morion," really an improved
  "chapelle-de-fer," was much in use. It had a curved top, surmounted by a
  comb, and a broad, turned-up brim, and was often elaborately engraved and
  gilt. The "cabasset" was a similar head-piece, but had a peaked top,
  surmounted by a small spike turned backwards, and generally a flatter,
  narrower brim than the morion. These three forms of helmet were all
  called casques.</p>

    606.</span>&mdash;"Grid-iron" Helmet (fifteenth century).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The barred or grilled helmet owed its introduction to tournaments with
  swords and clubs, which necessitated better opportunities of vision than
  the earlier tilting-helm afforded, sufficient though that was for
  encounters with the tilting-spear. The earliest form of this type of
  helmet will be seen in Fig. 606, which is termed a "grid-iron" helmet,
  developing shortly afterwards into the form of Fig. 607, which has a
  lattice-work visor. The former figure, the "grid-iron" helmet, is a <!--
  Page 316 --><span class="pagenum" title="358.png"><a
  name="page316"></a>{316}</span>representation taken from an original now
  in the possession of Count Hans Wilczek, of Vienna. Fig. 607, the helmet
  with the latticed visor, is from an example in the German National Museum
  at Nürnberg. Neither of these types of helmet appears to have been
  regularly adopted into heraldic art. Indeed they are seldom, if ever, to
  be found in heraldic emblazonment. For pictorial and artistic purposes
  they seem to be entirely supplanted in paintings, in seals, and in
  sculpture by the "grilled" helmet or "buckler." Whether this helmet, as
  we find it depicted in paintings or on seals, was ever really worn in
  battle or tournament seems very doubtful, and no actual instance appears
  to have been preserved. On the other hand, the so-called "Prankhelme"
  (pageant helmet) bucklers, frequently made of gilded leather and other
  materials, are extant in some number. It is evident from their nature,
  however, that they can only have been used for ceremonial or decorative
  purposes.</p>

  <p>Fig. 608 shows one of these buckled "pageant" helmets surmounted by
  the crest of the Margraviate of Burgau. Fig. 609 shows another of these
  pageant helmets, with the crest of Austria (ancient) or of Tyrol. These
  were borne, with many others of the same character, in the pageant of the
  funeral procession of the Emperor Frederick III. (IV.) in 1493. The
  helmets were made of leather, and gilded, the two crests being carved out
  of boards and painted. The Burgau wings, which are inclined very far
  forward, are: "Bendy of six argent and gules, charged with a pale or." In
  their normal position the wings are borne upright. The second crest,
  which is 86 cm. in height, is black, and adorned on the outside with
  eared pegs 4 cm. long, from which gold linden-leaves hang. These helmets
  and crests, which were formerly in St. Stephen's Cathedral, are now in
  the Vienna Historical Museum.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century the workmanship became
  inferior, and beauty of line was no longer sought after. Shortly
  afterwards helmets ceased to be worn outside the regular army, and with
  the subsequent evolution of military head coverings heraldry has no
  concern.</p>

  <p>As a part of a heraldic achievement the helmet is not so old as the
  shield. It was not until the introduction of the crest that any one
  thought of depicting a helmet with a shield.</p>

  <p>A careful and attentive examination of the early "Rolls of Arms," and
  of seals and other ancient examples of heraldic art and handicraft, will
  at once make it plainly apparent that the helmets then heraldically
  depicted were in close keeping and of the style actually in use for
  warfare, joust, or tournament at the period. This is particularly
  noticeable in the helmets on the stall plates of the Knights of the
  Garter in St. George's Chapel at Windsor. The helms on the early <!--
  Page 317 --><span class="pagenum" title="361.png"><a
  name="page317"></a>{317}</span>stall plates, though far from being
  identical in shape, all appear to be of the same class or type of
  tilting-helm drawn in profile. Amongst the early plates only one instance
  (Richard, Duke of Gloucester, elected 1475) can be found of the barred
  helmet. This is the period when helmets actually existed in fact, and
  were actually used, but at the end of the sixteenth and the beginning of
  the seventeenth centuries, when the helmet was being fast relegated to
  ceremonial usage and pictorial emblazonment, ingenious heralds began to
  evolve the system by which rank and degree were indicated by the
  helmet.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to consider British rules concerning the heraldic
  helmet, it may be well to note those which have been accepted abroad. In
  Germany heraldry has known but two classes of helmet, the open helmet
  guarded by bars (otherwise buckles or grilles), and the closed <!-- Page
  318 --><span class="pagenum" title="362.png"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span>or "visored" helmet. The latter was the
  helmet used by the newly ennobled, the former by the older families of
  higher position, it being originally held that only those families whose
  birth qualified them to tilt were permitted to use this buckled helmet.
  Tournaments were of course always conducted on very strict lines.
  Woodward reprints in his "Treatise on Heraldry" the "Tourney Regulations
  for the Exposure of Arms and Crest, drawn up by René, Duke of Anjou, King
  of Sicily and Jerusalem," from Menêtrier's <i>L'Origin des Armoiries</i>.
  The rules to be complied with are there set out. Fig. 12 herein is a
  representation of a "Helmschau," where the examination of the crests is
  being carried on. It is interesting to notice therein that the whole of
  the helmets without exception have the grilles. Germany was perhaps the
  earliest country to fall from grace in the matter, for towards the end of
  the fifteenth century the buckled helmet is found with the arms of the
  lower Briefadels (those ennobled by patent), and the practice continued
  despite the violent protests of the tournament families, who considered
  their prerogative had been infringed. The closed helmet consequently sank
  gradually in Germany to the grade of a mere burgess's helmet, and as such
  became of little account, although in former times it had been borne by
  the proudest houses.</p>

  <p>Similarly in France the "buckled" helmet was considered to be reserved
  for the military noblesse, and newly ennobled families were denied its
  use until the third generation, when they became <i>bons
  gentilhommes</i>. Woodward states that when "in 1372 Charles V. conferred
  on the bourgeoisie of Paris the right to use armorial bearings, it was
  strenuously denied that they could use the timbred helm. In 1568 an edict
  of Charles IX. prohibited the use of <i>armoiries timbrées</i> to any who
  were not noble by birth." The grilles of the helmet produced with the old
  French heralds the opportunity of a minutiæ of rule which, considering
  the multitude of rules fathered, rightly or wrongly, upon British
  heraldry, we may be devoutly happy never reached our shores. They
  assigned different numbers of grilles to different ranks, but as the
  writers differ as to the varying numbers, it is probable that such rules
  were never officially accepted even in that country. In France the rule
  was much as in this country, a gold helmet for the Sovereign, silver for
  princes and great nobles, steel for the remainder. It is curious that
  though the timbred helm was of course known in England whilst the
  controversy as to its heraldic use was raging in France and Germany, no
  heraldic use of it whatever occurs till the beginning of the seventeenth
  century. From Royalty to the humblest gentleman, all used for heraldic
  purposes the closed or visored helms.</p>

  <p>The present rules concerning helmets which hold in Great Britain are
  that the helmet of the Sovereign and the Royal princes of this <!-- Page
  319 --><span class="pagenum" title="363.png"><a
  name="page319"></a>{319}</span>country shall be of gold, placed in an
  affronté position, and shall have grilles. The helmet of a peer shall be
  of silver, shall be placed in profile, and shall have golden grilles,
  frequently stated to be five in number, a detail not stringently adhered
  to. The helmet of a knight or baronet shall be of steel, placed
  full-faced, and shall be open; whilst the helmet of an esquire or
  gentleman shall be of steel and in profile, with the visor closed. Within
  these limits considerable latitude is allowed, and even in official
  grants of arms, which, as far as emblazonment goes, are very much of a
  stereotyped style, actual unvarying adherence to a particular pattern is
  not insisted upon.</p>

  <p>The earliest instance amongst the Garter plates in which a helmet with
  grilles is used to denote the rank of a peer is the stall plate of Lord
  Knollys in 1615. In the Visitations but few instances can be found in
  which the arms of peers are included. Peers were not compelled to attend
  and enter their arms and pedigrees at Visitations, doubtless owing to the
  fact that no Garter King of Arms ever made a Visitation, whilst it has
  been the long-asserted prerogative of Garter to deal with peers and their
  arms by himself. At the same time, however, there are some number of
  instances of peers' arms and pedigrees in the Visitation Books, several
  occurring in the 1587 Visitation of Yorkshire. In these cases the arms of
  peers are set out with supporters and mottoes, but there is no difference
  between their helmets and what we should now term the helmet of an
  esquire or gentleman. This is all the more curious because neither helmet
  nor motto is found in the tricks given of the arms of commoners.
  Consequently one may with certainty date the introduction of the helmet
  with grilles as the distinguishing mark of a peer in this country between
  the years 1587 and 1615. The introduction of the open full-faced helmet
  as indicative of knight or baronet is known to date from about the period
  of the Restoration.</p>

  <p>Whilst these fixed rules as to helmets are still scrupulously adhered
  to by English heralds, Lyon King of Arms would seem to be inclined to let
  them quietly lapse into desuetude, and the emblazonment of the arms of
  Sir George Duff-Sutherland-Dunbar, Bart., in the Lyon Register at the
  recent rematriculation of his arms, affords an instance in which the
  rules have been ignored.</p>

  <p>Some of the objections one hears raised to official heraldry will not
  hold water when all facts are known; but one certainly thinks that those
  who object to the present helmet and its methods of usage have ample
  reason for such remarks as one frequently sees in print upon the subject.
  To put it mildly, it is absolutely ridiculous to see a helmet placed
  affronté, and a lion passant looking out over the side of it; or to see a
  helmet in profile with the crest of a man's head <!-- Page 320 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="364.png"><a
  name="page320"></a>{320}</span>affronté placed above it, and as a
  consequence also peeping over the side. The necessity for providing a
  resting-place for the crest other than unoccupied space has also led to
  the ridiculous practice of depicting the wreath or torse in the form of a
  straight bar balanced upon the apex of the helmet. The rule itself as to
  the positions of helmets for the varying ranks is officially recognised,
  and the elaboration of the rule with regard to the differing metals of
  the Royal helmet and the helmets of peers and knights and baronets is
  officially followed; though the supposed regulation, which requires that
  the helmet of an esquire or gentleman shall be of steel alone is not,
  inasmuch as the helmet painted upon a grant is <i>always</i> ornamented
  with gold.</p>

  <p>These rules in England only date from the times of the Stuarts, and
  they cannot be said to be advantageous from any point of view; they are
  certainly distinctly harmful from the artistic standpoint. It is plainly
  utterly impossible to depict some crests upon a profile helmet, and
  equally impossible to display others upon an affronté helmet. In Scotland
  the crests do not afford quite such a regular succession of glaring
  examples for ridicule as is the case in England. No need is recognised in
  Scotland for necessarily distinguishing the crest of one family from that
  of another, though proper differences are rigidly adhered to with regard
  to the coats of arms. Nevertheless, Scotland provides us with many crests
  which it is utterly impossible to actually carry on an actual helmet, and
  examples of this kind can be found in the rainbow which floats above the
  broken globe of the Hopes, and the coronets in space to which the hand
  points in the crest of the family of Dunbar of Boath, with many other
  similar absurdities.</p>

  <p>In England an equal necessity for difference is insisted upon in the
  crest as is everywhere insisted upon with regard to the coat of arms; and
  in the time of the late Garter King of Arms, it was rapidly becoming
  almost impossible to obtain a new crest which has not got a row of small
  objects in front of it, or else two somethings, one on either side.
  (Things, however, have now considerably improved.) If a crest is to be
  depicted between two ostrich feathers, for example, it stands to reason
  that the central object should be placed upon the centre of the helmet,
  whilst the ostrich feathers would be one on either side&mdash;that is,
  placed in a position slightly above the ears. Yet, if a helmet is to be
  rigidly depicted in profile, with such a crest, it is by no means
  inconceivable that the one ostrich feather at the one side would hide
  both the other ostrich feather and the central object, leaving the crest
  to appear when properly depicted (for example, if photographed from a
  profile view of an actual helmet) as a single ostrich feather. Take, for
  instance, the Sievier crest, which is an estoile between two ostrich
  feathers. If that crest were properly depicted upon a profile helmet, the
  one ostrich feather <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum" title="365.png"
  ><a name="page321"></a>{321}</span>would undoubtedly hide everything
  else, for it is hardly likely that the estoile would be placed
  edge-forwards upon an actual helmet; and to properly display it, it ought
  to take its place upon an affronté helmet. Under the present rules it
  would be officially depicted with the estoile facing the side, one
  ostrich feather in front over the nose, and the other at the back of the
  head, which of course reduces it to an absurdity. To take another
  example, one might instance the crest of Sir William Crookes. It is
  hardly to be supposed that a helmet would ever have been borne into a
  tournament surmounted by an elephant looking out over the side; it would
  most certainly have had its head placed to the front; and yet, because
  Sir William Crookes is a knight, he is required to use an affronté
  helmet, with a crest which most palpably was designed for use in profile.
  The absurd position which has resulted is chiefly due to the position
  rules and largely a consequence of the hideous British practice (for no
  other nation has ever adopted it) of depicting, as is so often done, a
  coat of arms and crest without the intervening helmet and mantling;
  though perhaps another cause may have had its influence. I allude to the
  fact that an animal's head, for example, in profile, is considered quite
  a different crest to the same animal's head when placed affronté; and so
  long as this idea holds, and so long as the rules concerning the position
  of the helmet exist, for so long shall we have these glaring and
  ridiculous anomalies. And whilst one generation of a family has an
  affronté helmet and another using the same crest may have a profile one,
  it is useless to design crests specifically to fit the one or the
  other.</p>

  <p>Mr. G. W. Eve, who is certainly one of the most accomplished heraldic
  artists of the present time, has adopted a plan in his work which, whilst
  conforming with the rules to which I have referred, has reduced the
  peculiarities resulting from their observance to a minimum. His plan is
  simple, inasmuch as, with a crest which is plainly affronté and has to be
  depicted upon a profile helmet, he slightly alters the perspective of
  each, twisting round the helmet, which, whilst remaining slightly in
  profile, more nearly approaches the affronté position, and bringing the
  crest slightly round to meet it. In this way he has obtained some very
  good results from awkward predicaments. Mr. Joseph Foster, in his
  "Peerage and Baronetage," absolutely discarded all rules affecting the
  position of the helmet; and though the artistic results may be excellent,
  his plan cannot be commended, because whilst rules exist they ought to be
  adhered to. At the same time, it must be frankly admitted that the laws
  of position seem utterly unnecessary. No other country has
  them&mdash;they are, as has been shown, impracticable from the artistic
  <!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum" title="366.png"><a
  name="page322"></a>{322}</span>standpoint; and there can be very little
  doubt that it is highly desirable that they should be wholly
  abolished.</p>

  <p>It is quite proper that there should be some means of distinction, and
  it would seem well that the helmet with grilles should be reserved for
  peers. In this we should be following or closely approximating to the
  rules observed formerly upon the Continent, and if all questions of
  position are waived the only difficulty which remains is the helmet of
  baronets and knights. The full-faced open helmet is ugly in the
  extreme&mdash;anything would be preferable (except an open helmet in
  profile), and probably it would be better to wipe out the rule on this
  point as well. Knights of any Order have the circle of that order within
  which to place their shields, and baronets have the augmentations of
  their rank and degree. The knight bachelor would be the only one to
  suffer. The gift of a plain circlet around the shield or (following the
  precedent of a baronet), a spur upon a canton or inescutcheon, could
  easily remove any cause of complaint.</p>

  <p>But whilst one may think it well to urge strongly the alteration of
  existing rules, it should not be considered permissible to ignore rules
  which undoubtedly do exist whilst those rules remain in force.</p>

  <p>The helmets of knights and baronets and of esquires and gentlemen, in
  accordance with present official practice, are usually ornamented with
  gold, though this would not appear to be a fixed and unalterable
  rule.</p>

  <p>When two or more crests need to be depicted, various expedients are
  adopted. The English official practice is to paint one helmet only, and
  both the crests are detached from it. The same plan was formerly adopted
  in Scotland. The dexter crest is naturally the more important and the
  principal one in each case. By using one helmet only the necessity of
  turning the dexter crest to face the sinister is obviated.</p>

  <p>The present official method adopted in England of depicting three
  crests is to use one helmet only, and all three crests face to the
  dexter. The centre one, which is placed on the helmet, is the principal
  or first crest, that on the dexter side the second, and the one on the
  sinister the third.</p>

  <p>In Germany, the land of many crests (no less than thirteen were borne
  above the shield of the Margraves of Brandenburg-Anspach), there has from
  the earliest times been a fixed invariable practice of never dissociating
  a crest from the helmet which supported it, and consequently one helmet
  to every crest has long been the only recognised procedure. In the United
  Kingdom duplication of crests is quite a modern practice. Amongst the
  Plantagenet Garter plates there is not a single example to be found of a
  coat of arms with more than a single crest, and there is no ancient
  British example of more <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum" title="367.png"
  ><a name="page323"></a>{323}</span>than one helmet which can be referred
  to for guidance. The custom originated in the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries in Germany. This point is more fully dealt with in the chapter
  devoted to the consideration of crests, but it may be here noted that in
  Austria a knight may place two and a baron three helmets over his shield.
  The Continental practice is as follows: When the number of the helms is
  even, they are arranged so that all look inwards towards the centre line
  of the escutcheon, half being turned to the dexter, half to the sinister.
  If the number be uneven, the principal helm is placed in the centre
  affronté, the others with their crests being turned towards it; thus,
  some face to the dexter, some to the sinister. The crests are always
  turned with the helmets. In Scandinavia the centre helm is affronté; the
  others, with their crests, are often turned outwards.</p>

  <p>English officialism, whilst confining its own emblazonments to one
  helmet only, has never sought to assert that the use of two or more was
  either incorrect or faulty heraldry, and particularly in these later days
  of the revival of heraldic art in this country, all heraldic artists,
  following the German example, are inclined to give each crest its own
  helmet. This practice has been adopted during the last few years by Lyon
  King of Arms, and now all paintings of arms in Lyon Register which have
  two crests have the same number of helmets. Some of the Bath stall plates
  in Henry VII.'s chapel in Westminster Abbey also display two helmets.</p>

  <p>When two helmets are used, it has been customary, still following the
  German model, to turn them to face each other, except in the cases of the
  full-faced helmets of a knight or baronet, and (with the same exception)
  when three helmets have been employed the outer ones have been placed to
  face the centre, whilst the centre one has been placed in profile, as
  would be the case were it standing alone. But the multiplication of
  English crests in number, all of which as granted are required to differ,
  has naturally resulted in the stereotyping of points of difference in
  attitude, &amp;c., and the inevitable consequence is unfortunately that
  without sacrificing this character of differentiation it is impossible to
  allow the English heraldic artist the same latitude and freedom of
  disposition with regard to crests that his German confrère enjoys. These
  remarks apply solely to English and Irish crests, for Scottish practices,
  requiring no differentiation in the crests, have left Scottish crests
  simple and unspoiled. In England the result is that to "play" with the
  position of a crest frequently results in an entire alteration of its
  character, and consequently, as there is nothing whatever in the nature
  of a law or of a rule to the contrary, it is quite as usual to now find
  that two profile helmets are both placed to face the dexter, as placed to
  face each other. Another point seems also in <!-- Page 324 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="368.png"><a name="page324"></a>{324}</span>England
  to have been lost sight of in borrowing our methods from Germany. They
  hold themselves at liberty to, and usually <i>do</i>, make all their
  <i>charges on the shield</i> face to the centre. This is never done in
  England, where all face to the dexter. It seems therefore to me an
  anomaly to apply one rule to the shield and another to the helmet, and
  personally I prefer that both helmets and all charges should face the
  dexter.</p>

  <p>In British heraldry (and in fact the rule is universal) no woman other
  than a reigning Sovereign is permitted to surmount her arms by a helmet.
  Woodward states that "Many writers have denied the right of ecclesiastics
  (and, of course, of women) to the use of helmet and crest. Spener, the
  great German herald, defends their use by ecclesiastics, and says that,
  in Germany at any rate, universal custom is opposed to the restriction.
  There the prelates, abbots, and abbesses, who held princely fiefs by
  military tenure, naturally retained the full knightly insignia."</p>

  <p>In official English heraldry, there is a certain amount of
  confirmation and a certain amount of contradiction of this supposed rule
  which denies a helmet to an ecclesiastic. A grant of arms to a clergyman
  at the present day, and at all times previously, after the granting of
  crests had become usual, contains the grant of the crest and the
  emblazonment shows the helmet. But the grant of arms to a bishop is
  different. The emblazonment of the arms is surmounted by a mitre, and the
  crest is depicted in the body of the patent away from and distinct from
  the emblazonment proper in the margin. But the fact that a crest is
  granted proves that there is not any disability inherent in the
  ecclesiastic which debars him from the possession of the helmet and
  crest, and the rule which must be deduced, and which really is the
  definite and accepted rule, is that a mitre cannot be displayed together
  with a helmet or crest. It must be one or other, and as the mitre is
  indicative of the higher rank, it is the crest and helmet which are
  discarded.</p>

  <p>There are few rules in heraldry to which exceptions cannot be found,
  and there is a painting now preserved in the College of Arms, which
  depicts the arms of the Bishop of Durham surmounted by a helmet, that in
  its turn being surmounted by the mitre of episcopal rank. But the
  Bishopric of Durham was, in addition to its episcopal character, a
  temporal Palatinate, and the arms of the Bishops of that See therefore
  logically present many differences and exceptions from established
  heraldic rules.</p>

  <p>The rules with regard to the use of helmets for the coats of arms of
  corporate bodies are somewhat vague and vary considerably. All counties,
  cities, and towns, and all corporate bodies to whom crests have been
  granted in England, have the ordinary closed profile helmet <!-- Page 325
  --><span class="pagenum" title="369.png"><a
  name="page325"></a>{325}</span>of an esquire or gentleman. No grant of a
  crest has as yet been made to an English university, so that it is
  impossible to say that no helmet would be allowed, or if it were allowed
  what it would be.</p>

  <p>For some reason the arms of the City of London are always depicted
  with the helmet of a peer, but as the crest is not officially recorded,
  the privilege necessarily has no official sanction or authority.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the helmet painted upon a grant of arms to town or city is
  always the open full-faced helmet of a knight or baronet. But in the
  grant of arms to a county, where it includes a crest, the helmet is that
  of an esquire, which is certainly curious.</p>

  <p>In Ireland no helmet at all was painted upon the patent granting arms
  to the city of Belfast, in spite of the fact that a crest was included in
  the grant, and the late Ulster King of Arms informed me he would not
  allow a helmet to any impersonal arms.</p>

  <p>Care should be taken to avoid errors of anachronism when depicting
  helmet and shield. The shapes of these should bear some approximate
  relation to each other in point of date. It is preferable that the helmet
  should be so placed that its lower extremity reaches somewhat over the
  edge of the shield. The inclined position of the shield in emblazonment
  is borrowed from the natural order of things, because the shield hanging
  by its chain or shield-strap (the guige), which was so balanced that the
  shield should most readily fall into a convenient position when slung on
  the rider's shoulders, would naturally retain its equilibrium only in a
  slanting direction. <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum" title="370.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXI</h5>

<h5>THE CREST</h5>

  <p>If uncertainty exists as to the origin of arms, it is as nothing to
  the huge uncertainty that exists concerning the beginnings of the crest.
  Most wonderful stories are told concerning it; that it meant this and
  meant the other, that the right to bear a crest was confined to this
  person or the other person. But practically the whole of the stories of
  this kind are either wild imagination or conjecture founded upon
  insufficient facts.</p>

  <p>The real facts&mdash;which one may as well state first as a basis to
  work upon&mdash;are very few and singularly unconvincing, and are useless
  as original data from which to draw conclusions.</p>

  <p>First of all we have the definite, assured, and certain fact that the
  earliest known instance of a crest is in 1198, and we find evidence of
  the use of arms before that date.</p>

  <p>The next fact is that we find infinitely more variation in the crests
  used by given families than in the arms, and that whilst the variations
  in the arms are as a rule trivial, and not affecting the general design
  of the shield, the changes in the crest are frequently radical, the crest
  borne by a family at one period having no earthly relation to that borne
  by the same family at another.</p>

  <p>Again, we find that though the occasional use of a crest can (by
  isolated instances) be taken back, as already stated, to a fairly early
  period, the use of crests did not become general until very much
  later.</p>

  <p>Another fact is that, except perhaps in the persons of sovereigns,
  there is no official instance, nor any other authentic instance of
  importance, in which a crest appears ever to have been used by a woman
  until these recent and unfortunate days when unofficial examples can be
  found of the wildest ignorance of all armorial rules.</p>

  <p>The foregoing may be taken as general principles which no authentic
  instance known can be said to refute.</p>

  <p>Bearing these in mind, let us now see what other results can be
  obtained by deduction from specific instances.</p>

  <p>The earliest form in which anything can be found in the nature of a
  crest is the lion upon the head-dress of Geoffrey, Count of Anjou (Fig.
  28). This has been already referred to. <!-- Page 327 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="371.png"><a name="page327"></a>{327}</span></p>

  <p>The helmet of Philippe D'Alsace, Count of Flanders (<i>c.</i> 1181),
  has painted upon the side the same figure of a lion which appears upon
  his shield.</p>

  <p>What is usually accepted as the earliest authenticated instance of a
  regular crest is that afforded by the Great Seal of King Richard I. of
  England, which shows over the helmet a lion passant painted upon the
  fan-shaped ornament which surmounts the helmet.</p>

  <p>If one accepts&mdash;as most people nowadays are inclined to
  do&mdash;the Darwinian theory of evolution, the presumption is that the
  development of the human being, through various intermediate links
  including the ape, can be traced back to those cell-like formations which
  are the most "original" types of life which are known to us. At the same
  time one is hardly disposed to assert that some antediluvian jellyfish
  away back in past ages was the first human being. By a similar, but
  naturally more restricted argument, one cannot accept these paintings
  upon helmets, nor possibly can one accept paintings upon the fan-like
  ornaments which surmounted the helmet, as examples of crests. The
  rudiments and origin of crests doubtless they were. Crests they were
  not.</p>

  <p>We must go back, once again, to the bed-rock of the peacock-popinjay
  vanity ingrained in human nature. The same impulse which nowadays leads
  to the decoration of the helmets of the Life Guards with horsehair plumes
  and regimental badges, the cocked hats of field-marshals and other
  officers with waving plumes, the képis of commissionaires, and the
  smasher hats of Colonial irregulars with cocks' feathers, the hat of the
  poacher and gamekeeper with a pheasant's feather, led unquestionably to
  the "decoration" of the helmets of the armoured knights of old. The
  matter was just a combination of decoration and vanity. At first (Fig.
  569) they frequently painted their helmets, and as with the gradual
  evolution and crystallisation of armory a certain form of decoration (the
  device upon his shield) became identified with a certain person, that
  particular device was used for the decoration of the helmet and painted
  thereupon.</p>

  <p>Then it was found that a fan-shaped erection upon the helmet improved
  its appearance, and, without adding greatly to its weight, advantaged it
  as a head protection by attracting the blow of an opponent's sword, and
  lessening or nullifying its force ere the blow reached the actual
  crown-plates of the helmet. Possibly in this we see the true origin (as
  in the case of the scalloped edges of the mantling) of the serrated
  border which appears upon these fan-shaped erections. But this last
  suggestion is no more than a conjecture of my own, and may not be
  correct, for human nature has always had a weakness for decoration, and
  ever has been agreeable to pay the extra <!-- Page 328 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="372.png"><a name="page328"></a>{328}</span>penny
  in the "tuppence" for the coloured or decorated variety. The many
  instances which can be found of these fan-shaped ornaments upon helmets
  in a perfectly undecorated form leads me to unhesitatingly assert that
  they originated <i>not</i> as crests, nor as a vehicle for the display of
  crests, but as an integral and protective part of the <i>helmet</i>
  itself. The origin of the crest is due to the decoration of the fan. The
  derivation of the word "crest," from the Latin <i>crista</i>, a cock's
  comb, should put the supposition beyond any doubt.</p>

  <p>Disregarding crests of later grant or assumption, one can assert with
  confidence that a large proportion of those&mdash;particularly in German
  armory, where they are so frequent&mdash;which we now find blazoned or
  depicted as wings or plumes, carrying a device, are nothing more than
  developments of or derivatives from these fan-shaped ornaments.</p>

  <p>These fans being (from other reasons) in existence, of course, and
  very naturally, were painted and decorated, and equally of course such
  decoration took the form of the particular decoration associated with the
  owner, namely, the device upon the shield. It seems to me, and for long
  has so seemed, essentially strange that no specialist authority, writing
  upon armory, has noticed that these "fans" (as I will call them) are
  really a part, though possibly only a decorative part, of the helmet
  itself. There has always in these matters been far too great a tendency
  on the part of writers to accept conclusions of earlier authorities ready
  made, and to simply treat these fans as selected and chosen crests. Figs.
  610-612 are instances of helmets having these fans. All are <!-- Page 329
  --><span class="pagenum" title="373.png"><a
  name="page329"></a>{329}</span>taken from seals, and it is quite possible
  that the actual fans upon the seal helmets had some device painted upon
  them which it was impossible by reason of the size to represent upon the
  seal. As has been already stated, the great seal of Richard I. does show
  a lion painted on the fan.</p>

  <p>There are many examples of the heraldic development of these
  fans,&mdash;for their use obtained even in this country long after the
  real heraldic crest had an assured footing&mdash;and a typical example
  occurs in Fig. 613, but probably the best-known instance, one which has
  been often illustrated, is that from the effigy of Sir Geoffrey de
  Luttrell (<i>c.</i> 1340), which shows a fan of this character upon which
  the entire Luttrell arms are depicted.</p>

</td></tr></table>

  <p>A much later instance in this country will be found in the seal (dated
  1539) of the City of London, which shows upon the helmet one of these
  fan-shaped ornaments, charged with the cross of the City arms (Fig.
  614).</p>

  <p>The arms of the City of London are recorded in the College of Arms
  (Vincent) without a crest (and by the way without supporters) and this
  seal affords a curious but a very striking and authentic instance of the
  extreme accuracy of the records of the College of Arms. There being no
  crest for the City of London at the time of the preparation of this seal,
  recourse was had to the ancient practice of depicting the whole or a part
  (in this case a part) of the device of the shield upon a fan surmounting
  the helmet. In course of time this fan, in the case of London, as in so
  many other cases, has through ignorance been <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="374.png"><a
  name="page330"></a>{330}</span>converted or developed into a wing, but
  the "rays" of the fan in this instance are preserved in the "rays" of the
  dragon's wing (charged with a cross) which the crest is now supposed to
  be.</p>

  <p>Whilst dealing with the arms of London, one of the favourite "flaring"
  examples of ancient but unrecorded arms often mentioned as an instance in
  which the Records of the College of Arms are at fault, perhaps I may be
  pardoned for adding that the shield <i>is</i> recorded. The crest and
  supporters are not. The seeming omission as to the crest is explained
  above. The real supporters of the City of London, to which a claim by
  user <i>could</i> (even now) be established (they are two lions, not
  dragons), had, with the single exception of their use upon the Mayor's
  seal, which use is continued to the present day, been practically
  discarded. Consequently the lions as supporters remained unclaimed, and
  therefore are not recorded.</p>

  <p>The supporters now used (two dragons) are <i>raw new</i> adornments,
  of which no example can be found before the seventeenth century. Those
  naturally, being "assumed" without authority at so recent a date, are not
  recorded, which is yet another testimony to the impartial accuracy of the
  Heralds' College Records.</p>

  <p>The use of the fan-crest has long been obsolete in British armory, in
  which it can hardly ever be said to have had a very great footing, unless
  such use was prevalent in the thirteenth century; but it still survives
  in Germany at the present day, where, in spite of the fact that many of
  these fans have now degenerated into reduplications of the arms upon
  wings or plumes of feathers, other crests to a considerable number are
  still displayed upon "fans."</p>

  <p>Many of the current practices in British armory are the culmination of
  long-continued ignorance. Some, mayhap, can be allowed to pass without
  comment, but others deserve at any rate their share of criticism and
  remark. Amongst such may be included the objectionable practice, in the
  grants of so many modern crests, of making the crest itself a
  <i>shield</i> carrying a repetition of the arms or some other device, or
  of introducing in the crest an escutcheon. To the resuscitation of these
  "fan" repetitions of the shield device there is not, and cannot be, any
  objection. One would even, in these days of the multiplication of
  differentiated crests, recommend this as a relief from the abominable
  rows of assorted objects nowadays placed (for the purposes of
  differentiation) in front of so many modern crests. One would gladly see
  a reversion to the German development (from this source) of wings charged
  with the arms or a part of the armorial device; but one of the things a
  new grantee should pray to be delivered from is an escutcheon of any
  sort, shape, or form in the crest assigned to him. <!-- Page 331 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="375.png"><a name="page331"></a>{331}</span></p>

  <p>To return, however, to the "fans" upon the early helmets. Many of the
  examples which have come down to us show the fan of a rather diminutive
  height, but (in the form of an arc of a much enlarged circle) projected
  far forward beyond the front of the helmet, and carried far back,
  apparently as a safeguard from blows which would otherwise descend upon
  the neck. (A survival of the fan, by the way, may perhaps be found in the
  dragoon helmets of the time of the Peninsular War, in the firemen's
  helmets of to-day, and in the helmets now worn by different regiments in
  the Italian army.) The very shape of these fans should prove they were
  originally a protective part of the helmet. The long low shape, however,
  did not, as a general circumstance, lend itself to its decoration by a
  duplication thereupon of the whole of the arms. Consequently these fans
  will nearly always be found simply adorned with one figure from the
  shield. It should not be forgotten that we are now dealing with a period
  in armory when the charges upon the shield itself were very much, as far
  as number and position are concerned, of an indeterminate character. If
  they were indeterminate for the shield, it evidences that there cannot
  have been any idea of a necessity to repeat the whole of the device upon
  the fan. As there was seldom room or opportunity for the display of the
  whole device, we invariably find that these fan decorations were a
  duplication of a distinctive part, but not necessarily the whole of the
  device; and this device was disposed in the most suitable position which
  the shape of the fan would accommodate. Herein is the explanation of the
  fact that whilst the arms of Percy, Talbot, and Mowbray were all, in
  varying tinctures, a lion rampant, the crest in each case was a lion
  passant or statant. In short, the fan did not lend itself to the
  representation of a lion rampant, and consequently there is no early
  instance of such a crest. Perhaps the insecurity of a large and heavy
  crest balanced upon one leg may be an added reason.</p>

  <p>The next step in the evolution of the crest, there can be little
  doubt, was the cutting of the fan into the outline of the crest, and
  though I know of no instance of such a crest on any effigy, there can be
  no reasonable doubt on the point, if a little thought is given to the
  matter. Until a very much later period, we never find in any heraldic
  representation that the helmet or crest are represented in an affronté
  position. Why? Simply because crests at that period were merely profile
  representations.</p>

  <p>In later days, when tournament crests were made of leather, the weight
  even of these was very considerable, but for tournament purposes that
  weight could be endured. Half-a-dozen courses down the <i>barrière</i>
  would be a vastly different matter to a whole day under arms in actual
  battle. Now a crest cut out from a thin plate of metal set <!-- Page 332
  --><span class="pagenum" title="376.png"><a
  name="page332"></a>{332}</span>on edge would weigh but little. But
  perhaps the strongest proof of all is to be found in the construction of
  so many German crests, which are adorned down the back with a fan.</p>

  <p>Now it is hardly likely, if the demi-lion in relief had been the
  earliest form, that the fan would have been subsequently added to it. The
  fan is nothing more than the remains of the original fan-shaped ornament
  left when the crest, or most likely only the front outline of it, had
  been cut out in profile from the fan. We have no instance until a very
  much later period of a crest which could not be depicted in profile, and
  in the representations of crests upon seals we have no means of forming a
  certain judgment that these representations are not of profile crests,
  for the very nature of the craft of seal-engraving would lead the
  engraver to add a certain amount of relief, even if this did not actually
  exist. It is out of the question to suppose, by reason of their weight,
  that crests were made in metal. But if made of leather, as were the
  tournament crests, what protection did the crest add to the helmet? The
  fact that wreaths and coronets did not come into use at the earliest
  advent of crests is confirmatory evidence of the fact that modelled
  crests did not exist, inasmuch as the fan prolonged in front and
  prolonged behind was narrowed at its point of contact with the helmet
  into such a diminished length that it was comparatively easy to slip the
  mantling by means of a slit over the fan, or even drape it round it.</p>

  <p>Many of the old illustrations of tournaments and battles which have
  come down to us show no crests on the helmets, but merely plumes of
  feathers or some fan-shaped erection. Consequently it is a fairly safe
  conclusion that for the actual purposes of warfare modelled crests never
  had any real existence, or, if they had any such existence, that it was
  most limited. Modelled crests were tournament crests. The crests that
  were used in battle must have been merely cut out in profile from the
  fan. Then came the era, in Plantagenet times, of the tournament. We talk
  glibly about tournaments, but few indeed really know much about them.
  Trial by combat and the real tournament <i>à l'outrance</i> seldom
  occurred, and though trial by combat remained upon the statute-book until
  the 59 Geo. III., it was seldom invoked. Tournaments were chiefly in the
  nature of athletic displays, taking the place of our games and sports,
  and inasmuch as they contributed to the training of the soldier, were
  held in the high repute that polo, for example, now enjoys amongst the
  upper and military classes. Added to this, the tournament was the
  essential climax of ceremony and ceremonial, and in all its details was
  ordered by such strict regulations, rules, and supervision that its
  importance and its position in the public and official estimate was far
  in advance of its present-day equivalents. <!-- Page 333 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="377.png"><a name="page333"></a>{333}</span></p>

  <p>The joust was fought with tilting-spears, the "tourney" with swords.
  The rules and regulations for jousts and tournaments drawn up by the High
  Constable of England in the reign of Edward IV. show clearly that in
  neither was contemplated any risk of life.</p>

  <p>In the tourney the swords were blunted and without points, but the
  principal item was always the joust, which was fought with tilting-spears
  and shields. Many representations of the tourney show the participants
  without shields. The general ignorance as to the manner in which the tilt
  was run is very widespread. A strong barrier was erected straight down
  the centre of the lists, and the knights were placed one on either side,
  so that by no possible chance could the two horses come into contact.
  Those who will read Mallory's "Morte d'Arthur" carefully&mdash;bearing in
  mind that Mallory described legendary events of an earlier period clothed
  in the manners and customs of his own day (time of Edward IV.), and made
  no attempt to reproduce the manners and customs and real atmosphere of
  the Arthurian times, which could have had no relation to the manners and
  proceedings which Sir Thomas Mallory employs in telling his
  legends&mdash;will notice that, when it came to jousting, some half-dozen
  courses would be all that were run between contending knights. In fact
  the tournament rules above referred to say, for the tourney, that two
  blows at passage and ten at the joining ought to suffice. The time which
  this would occupy would not exceed the period for which any man could
  easily sustain the weight of a modelled crest.</p>

  <p>Another point needs to be borne in mind. The result of a joust
  depended upon the points scored, the highest number being gained for the
  absolute unhorsing of an opponent. This, however, happened comparatively
  seldom, and points or "spears" were scored for the lances broken upon an
  opponent's helmet, shield, or body, and the points so scored were subject
  to deduction if the opponent's horse were touched, and under other
  circumstances. The head of the tilting-spear which was used was a kind of
  rosette, and heraldic representations are really incorrect in adding a
  point when the weapon is described as a tilting-spear. Whilst a fine
  point meeting a wooden shield or metal armour would stick in the one or
  glance off the other, and neither result in the breaking of the lance nor
  in the unhorsing of the opponent, a broad rosette would convey a heavy
  shock. But to effect the desired object the tilting-spear would need to
  meet resistance, and little would be gained by knocking off an opponent's
  ornamental crest. Certainly no prize appears to have been allotted for
  the performance of this feat (which always attracts the imagination of
  the novelist), whilst there was for striking the "sight" of the helmet.
  Consequently there was nothing to be gained from the protection to <!--
  Page 334 --><span class="pagenum" title="378.png"><a
  name="page334"></a>{334}</span>the helmet which the fan of earlier date
  afforded, and the tendency of ceremonial led to the use in tournaments of
  helmets and elaborate crests which were not those used in battle. The
  result is that we find these tournament or ceremonial crests were of
  large and prominent size, and were carved in wood, or built up of
  leather. But I firmly believe that these crests were used only for
  ceremonial and tournament purposes, and were never actually worn in
  battle. That these modelled crests in relief are the ones that we find
  upon effigies is only natural, and what one would expect, inasmuch as a
  man's effigy displayed his garments and accoutrements in the most ornate
  and honourable form. The same idea exists at the present day. The
  subjects of modern effigies and modern portraits are represented in
  robes, and with insignia which are seldom if ever worn, and which
  sometimes even have no existence in fact. In the same way the ancient
  effigies are the representations of the ceremonial dress and not the
  everyday garb of those for whom they stand. But even allowing all the
  foregoing, it must be admitted that it is from these ceremonial or
  tournament helmets and crests that the heraldic crest has obtained its
  importance, and herein lies the reason of the exaggerated size of early
  heraldic crests, and also the unsuitability of some few for actual use.
  Tournaments were flourishing in the Plantagenet, Yorkist, and Lancastrian
  periods, and ended with the days of the Tudor dynasty; and the
  Plantagenet period witnessed the rise of the ceremonial and heraldic
  crest. But in the days when crests had any actual existence they were
  made to fit the helmet, and the crests in Figs. 615-618 show crests very
  much more naturally disposed than those of later periods. <!-- Page 335
  --><span class="pagenum" title="379.png"><a
  name="page335"></a>{335}</span>Crests appear to have come into wider and
  more general use in Germany at an earlier period than is the case in this
  country, for in the early part of the thirteenth century seals are there
  to be met with having only the device of helmet and crest thereupon, a
  proof that the "oberwappen" (helmet and crest) was then considered of
  equal or greater value than the shield.</p>

  <p>The actual tournament crests were made of light material, pasteboard,
  cloth, or a leather shell over a wood or wire framework filled with tow,
  sponge, or sawdust. Fig. 271, which shows the shield, helmet, and crest
  of the Black Prince undoubtedly contemporary, dating from 1376, and now
  remaining in Canterbury Cathedral, is made of leather and is a good
  example of an actual crest, but even this, there can be little doubt, was
  never carried in battle or tournament, and is no more than a ceremonial
  crest made for the funeral pageant.</p>

  <p>The heraldic wings which are so frequently met with in crests are not
  the natural wings of a bird, but are a development from the fan, and in
  actual crests were made of wooden or basket-work strips, and probably at
  an earlier date were not intended to represent wings, but were mere
  pieces of wood painted and existing for the display of a certain device.
  Their shape and position led to their transition into "wings," and then
  they were covered with dyed or natural-coloured feathers. It was the art
  of heraldic emblazonment which ignored the practical details, that first
  copied the wing from nature.</p>

  <p>Actual crests were fastened to the helmets they surmounted by <!--
  Page 336 --><span class="pagenum" title="380.png"><a
  name="page336"></a>{336}</span>means of ribbons, straps, laces (which
  developed later into the fillet and torse), or rivets, and in Germany
  they were ornamented with hanging and tinkling metal leaves, tiny bells,
  buffalo horns, feathers, and projecting pieces of wood, which formed
  vehicles for still further decorative appendages.</p>

  <p>Then comes the question, what did the crest signify? Many have
  asserted that no one below the rank of a knight had the right to use a
  crest; in fact some writers have asserted, and doubtless correctly as
  regards a certain period, that only those who were of tournament rank
  might assume the distinction, and herein lies another confirmation of the
  supposition that crests had a closer relation to the tournament than to
  the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Doubts as to a man's social position might disqualify him from
  participation in a tournament&mdash;hence the "helme-schau" previously
  referred to&mdash;but they certainly never relieved him from the
  obligations of warfare imposed by the tenure under which he held his
  lands. There is no doubt, however, that whatever the regulation may have
  been&mdash;and there seems little chance of our ever obtaining any real
  knowledge upon the point&mdash;the right to display a crest was an
  additional privilege and honour, something extra and beyond the right to
  a shield of arms. For how long any such supposition held good it is
  difficult to say, for whilst we find in the latter part of the fourteenth
  century that all the great nobles had assumed and were using crests, and
  whilst there is but one amongst the Plantagenet Garter plates without a
  crest where a helmet has been represented above the shield, we also find
  that the great bulk of the lesser landed gentry bore arms, but made no
  pretension to a crest. The lesser gentry were bound to fight in war, but
  not necessarily in the tournament. Arms were a necessity of warfare,
  crests were not. This continued to be the case till the end of the
  sixteenth century, for we find that at one of the Visitations no crests
  whatever are inserted with the arms and pedigrees of the families set out
  in the Visitation Book, and one is probably justified in assuming that
  whilst this state of feeling and this idea existed, the crest was highly
  thought of, and valued possibly beyond the shield of arms, for with those
  of that rank of life which aspired to the display of a crest the right to
  arms would be a matter of course. In the latter part of the reign of
  Queen Elizabeth and in Stuart days the granting of crests to ancient arms
  became a widespread practice. Scores upon scores of such grants can be
  referred to, and I have myself been led to the irresistible conclusion
  that the opportunity afforded by the grant of a crest was urged by the
  heralds and officers of arms, in order to give them the opportunity of
  confirming and recording arms which they knew needed such confirmation to
  be</p>

<p><!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum" title="383.png"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span></p>

  <p>rendered legal, without giving offence to those who had borne these
  arms merely by strength of user for some prolonged but at the same time
  insufficient period to confer an unquestioned right. That has always
  seemed to me the obvious reason which accounts for these numberless
  grants of crests to apparently existing arms, which arms are recited and
  emblazoned in the patents, because there are other grants of crests which
  can be referred to, though these are singularly few in number, in which
  the arms are entirely ignored. But as none of these grants, which are of
  a crest only, appear to have been made to families whose right to arms
  was not absolutely beyond question or dispute, the conclusion above
  recited appears to be irresistible. The result of these numerous grants
  of crests, which I look upon as carrying greater importance in the sense
  that they were also confirmations of the arms, resulted in the fact that
  the value and dignity of the crest slowly but steadily declined, and the
  cessation of tournaments and, shortly afterwards, the marked decline in
  funereal pageantry no doubt contributed largely to the same result.
  Throughout the Stuart period instances can be found, though not very
  frequently, of grants of arms without the grant of a crest being included
  in the patent; but the practice was soon to entirely cease, and roughly
  speaking one may assert that since the beginning of the Hanoverian
  dynasty no person has ever been granted arms without the corresponding
  grant of a crest, if a crest could be properly borne with the arms. Now
  no crest has ever been granted where the right to arms has not existed or
  been simultaneously conferred, and therefore, whilst there are still many
  coats of arms legally in existence without a crest, a crest cannot exist
  without a coat of arms, so that those people, and they are many, who
  vehemently assert a right to the "<i>crest</i> of their family," whilst
  admitting they have no right to arms, stand self-convicted heraldically
  both of having spoken unutterable rubbish, and of using a crest to which
  they can have no possible right. One exception, and one only, have I ever
  come across to the contrary, and very careful inquiry can bring me
  knowledge of no other. That crest is the crest of a family of Buckworth,
  now represented by Sir Charles Buckworth-Herne-Soame, Bart. This family
  at the time of the Visitations exhibited a certain coat of arms and
  crest. The coat of arms, which doubtless interfered with the rights of
  some other family, was respited for further proof; but the crest, which
  did not, appears to have been allowed, and as nothing further was done
  with regard to the arms, the crest stood, whilst the arms were bad. But
  even this one exception has long since been rectified, for when the
  additional name and arms of Soame were assumed by Royal License, the arms
  which had been exhibited and respited were (with the addition of an
  ermine spot as a charge upon the chevron) granted as the arms of
  Buckworth to be borne quarterly with the arms of Soame.</p>

  <p>With the cessation of tournaments, we get to the period which some
  writers have stigmatised as that of "paper" heraldry. That is a reference
  to the fact that arms and crests ceased to be painted upon shields or
  erected upon helmets that enjoyed actual use in battle and tournament.
  Those who are so ready to decry modern heraldry forget that from its very
  earliest existence heraldry has always had the <i>same</i> significance
  as a symbol of rank and social position which it now enjoys and which
  remains undiminished in extent, though doubtless less potent in effect.
  They forget also that from the very earliest period armory had three
  uses&mdash;viz. its martial use, its decorative use, and its use as a
  symbol of ownership. The two latter uses still remain in their entirety,
  and whilst that is the case, armory cannot be treated as a dead
  science.</p>

  <p>But with the cessation of tournaments the decorative became the chief
  use of arms, and the crest soon ceased to have that distinctive
  adaptability to the purpose of a helmet ornament. Up to the end of the
  Tudor period crests had retained their original simplicity. Animals'
  heads and animals passant, human heads and demi-animals, comprised the
  large majority of the early crests. Scottish heraldry in a marked degree
  has retained the early simplicity of crests, though at the expense of
  lack of distinction between the crests of different families. German
  heraldry has to a large extent retained the same character as has
  Scottish armory, and though many of the crests are decidedly elaborated,
  it is noticeable that this elaboration is never such as to render the
  crest unsuitable for its true position upon a helmet.</p>

  <p>In England this aspect of the crest has been almost entirely lost
  sight of, and a large proportion of the crests in modern English grants
  are utterly unsuitable for use in relief upon an actual helmet. Our
  present rules of position for a helmet, and our unfortunate stereotyped
  form of wreath, are largely to blame, but the chief reason is the
  definite English rule that the crests of separate English families must
  be differentiated as are the arms. No such rule holds good in Scotland,
  hence their simple crests.</p>

  <p>Whether the rule is good or bad it is difficult to say. When all the
  pros and cons have been taken into consideration, the whole discussion
  remains a matter of opinion, and whilst one dislikes the Scottish idea
  under which the same identical crest can be and regularly is granted to
  half-a-dozen people of as many different surnames, one objects very
  considerably to the typical present-day crest of an English grant of
  arms. Whilst a collar can be put round an animal's neck, and whilst it
  can hold objects in its mouth or paws, it does seem <!-- Page 339
  --><span class="pagenum" title="385.png"><a
  name="page339"></a>{339}</span>ridiculous to put a string of varied and
  selected objects "in front" of it, when these plainly would only be
  visible from one side, or to put a crest "between" objects if these are
  to be represented "fore and aft," one toppling over the brow of the
  wearer of the helmet and the other hanging down behind.</p>

  <p>The crests granted by the late Sir Albert Woods, Garter, are the
  crying grievance of modern English heraldry, and though a large
  proportion are far greater abortions than they need be, and though
  careful thought and research even yet will under the present régime
  result in the grant of at any rate a quite unobjectionable crest,
  nevertheless we shall not obtain a real reform, or attain to any
  appreciable improvement, until the "position" rule as to helmets is
  abolished. Some of the crests mentioned hereunder are typical and awful
  examples of modern crests.</p>

  <p>We now come to the subject of the inheritance of crests, concerning
  which there has been much difference of opinion.</p>

  <p>It is very usually asserted that until a comparatively recent date
  crests were not hereditary, but were assumed, discarded, and changed at
  pleasure. Like many other incorrect statements, there is a certain
  modicum of truth in the statement, for no doubt whilst arms themselves
  <!-- Page 340 --><span class="pagenum" title="386.png"><a
  name="page340"></a>{340}</span>had a more or less shifting character,
  crests were certainly not "fixed" to any greater extent.</p>

  <p>But I think no one has as yet discovered, or at any rate brought into
  notice, the true facts of the case, or the real position of the matter,
  and I think I am the first to put into print what actually were the rules
  which governed the matter. The rules, I believe, were undoubtedly
  these:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Crests were, save in the remote beginning of things heraldic,
  definitely hereditary. They were hereditary even to the extent (and
  herein lies the point which has not hitherto been observed) that they
  were transmitted by an heiress. Perhaps this heritability was limited to
  those cases in which the heiress transmitted the <i>de facto</i> headship
  of her house. We, judging by present laws, look upon the crest as a part
  of the <i>one</i> heraldic achievement inseparable from the shield. What
  proof have we that in early times any necessary connection between arms
  and crest existed? We have none. The shield of arms was one inheritance,
  descending by known rules. The crest was another, but a separate
  inheritance, descending equally through an heir or coheir-general. The
  crest was, as an inheritance, as separate from the shield as were the
  estates then. The social conditions of life prevented the possibility of
  the existence or inheritance of a crest where arms did not exist. But a
  man inheriting several coats of arms from different heiress ancestresses
  could marshal them all upon one shield, and though we find the heir often
  made selection at his pleasure, and marshalled the arms in various
  methods, the determination of which was a mere matter of arbitrary
  choice, he could, if he wished, use them all upon one shield. But he had
  but one helmet, and could use and display but one crest. So that, if he
  had inherited two, he was forced to choose which he would use, though he
  sometimes tried to combine two into one device. It is questionable if an
  instance can be found in England of the regular display of two helmets
  and crests together, surmounting one shield, before the eighteenth
  century, but there are countless instances of the contemporary but
  separate display of two different crests, and the Visitation Records
  afford us some number of instances of this tacit acknowledgment of the
  inheritance of more than one crest.</p>

  <p>The patent altering or granting the Mowbray crest seems to me clear
  recognition of the right of inheritance of a crest passing through an
  heir female. This, however, it must be admitted, may be really no more
  than a grant, and is not in itself actual evidence that any crest had
  been previously borne. My own opinion, however, is that it is fair
  presumptive evidence upon the point, and conveys an alteration and not a
  grant.</p>

  <p>The translation of this Patent (Patent Roll 339, 17 Ric. II. pt. 1,
  <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum" title="387.png"><a
  name="page341"></a>{341}</span>memb. 2) is as follows: "The King to all
  to whom, &amp;c., Greeting, Know that whereas our well-beloved and
  faithful kinsman, Thomas, Earl-Marshal and Earl of Nottingham, has a just
  hereditary title to bear for his crest a leopard or with a white label,
  which should be of right the crest of our eldest son if we had begotten a
  son. We, for this consideration, have granted for us and our heirs to the
  said Thomas and his heirs that for a difference in this crest they shall
  and may bear a leopard, and in place of a label a crown argent, without
  hindrance from us or our heirs aforesaid.&mdash;In witness, &amp;c.
  Witness the King at Westminster, the 12th day of January [17 Ric. II.].
  By writ of Privy Seal."</p>

  <p>Cases will constantly be found in which the crests have been changed.
  I necessarily totally exclude from consideration crests which have been
  changed owing to specific grants, and also changes due to the discarding
  of crests which can be shown to have been borne without right. Changes in
  crests must also be disregarded where the differences in emblazonment are
  merely differences in varying designs of the same crest. Necessarily from
  none of these instances can a law of inheritance be deduced. But if other
  changes in the crests of important families be considered, I think it
  will be very evident that practically the whole of these are due to the
  inheritance through heiresses or ancestresses of an alternative crest. It
  can be readily shown that selection played an important part in the
  marshalling of quarterings upon an escutcheon, and where important
  quarterings were inherited they are as often as not found depicted in the
  first quarter. Thus the Howards have borne at different periods the wings
  of Howard; the horse of Fitzalan; and the Royal crest granted to the
  Mowbrays with remainder to the heir general; and these crests have been
  borne, as will be seen from the Garter plates, quite irrespective of what
  the surname in use may have been. Consequently it is very evident the
  crests were considered to be inherited with the representation of the
  different families. The Stourton crest was originally a stag's head, and
  is to be seen recorded in one of the Visitations, and upon the earliest
  seal in existence of any member of the family. But after the inheritance
  through the heiress of Le Moyne, the Le Moyne crest of the demi-monk was
  adopted. The Stanleys, Earls of Derby, whatever their original crest may
  have been, inherited the well-known bird and bantling of the family of
  Lathom. The Talbot crest was originally a talbot, and this is still so
  borne by Lord Talbot of Malahide: it was recorded at the Visitation of
  Dublin; but the crest at present borne by the Earls of Shrewsbury is
  derived from the arms inherited by descent from Gwendolin, daughter of
  Rhys ap Griffith. The Nevill crest was a bull's head as it is now borne
  by the Marquess <!-- Page 342 --><span class="pagenum" title="388.png"><a
  name="page342"></a>{342}</span>of Abergavenny, and as it will be seen on
  the Garter plate of William Nevill, Lord Fauconberg. An elder brother of
  Lord Fauconberg had married the heiress of the Earl of Salisbury, and was
  summoned to Parliament in her earldom. He quartered her arms, which
  appear upon his Garter plate and seal, in the first and fourth quarters
  of his shield, and adopted her crest. A younger son of Sir Richard
  Nevill, Earl of Salisbury, bore the same crest differenced by two
  annulets conjoined, which was the difference mark added to the shield.
  The crest of Bourchier was a soldan's head crowned, and with a pointed
  cap issuing from the crown, but when the barony of Bourchier passed to
  the family of Robsart, as will be seen from the Garter plate of Sir Lewis
  Robsart, Lord Bourchier, the crest of Bourchier was adopted with the
  inheritance of the arms and Barony of Bourchier.</p>

  <p>I am aware of no important case in English heraldry where the change
  has been due to mere caprice, and it would seem therefore an almost
  incontrovertible assertion that changes were due to inheritance, and if
  that can be established it follows even more strongly that until the days
  when armory was brought under rigid and official control, and even until
  a much later date, say up to the beginning of the Stuart period, crests
  were heritable through heiresses equally with quarterings. The fact that
  we find comparatively few changes considering the number of crests in
  existence is by no means a refutation of this theory, because a man had
  but one helmet, and was forced therefore to make a selection. Unless,
  therefore, he had a very strong inclination it would be more likely that
  he would select the crest he was used to than a fresh one. I am by no
  means certain that to a limited extent the German idea did not hold in
  England. This was, and is, that the crest had not the same personal
  character that was the case with the arms, but was rather attached to or
  an appanage of the territorial fief or lordship. By the time of the
  Restoration any idea of the transmission of crests through heiresses had
  been abandoned. We then find a Royal License necessary for the assumption
  of arms and crests. Since that date it has been and at the present time
  it is stringently held, and is the official rule, that no woman can bear
  or inherit a crest, and that no woman can transmit a right to one. Whilst
  that is the official and accepted interpretation of heraldic law upon the
  point, and whilst it cannot now be gainsaid, it cannot, however, be
  stated that the one assertion is the logical deduction of the other, for
  whilst a woman cannot inherit a lordship of Parliament, she undoubtedly
  can transmit one, together with the titular honours, the enjoyment of
  which is not denied to her.</p>

  <p>In Scotland crests have always had a very much less important position
  than in England. There has been little if any continuity <!-- Page 343
  --><span class="pagenum" title="389.png"><a
  name="page343"></a>{343}</span>with regard to them, and instances of
  changes for which caprice would appear to be the only reason are met with
  in the cases of a large proportion of the chief families in that kingdom.
  To such a widespread extent has the permissive character been allowed to
  the crest, that many cases will be found in which each successive
  matriculation for the head of the house, or for a cadet, has produced a
  change in the crest, and instances are to be found where the different
  crests are the only existing differences in the achievements of a number
  of cadets of the same family. At the present time, little if any
  objection is ever made to an entire and radical change in the
  crest&mdash;if this is wished at the time of a rematriculation&mdash;and
  as far as I can gather such changes appear to have always been permitted.
  Perhaps it may be well here to point out that this is not equivalent to
  permission to change the crest at pleasure, because the patent of
  matriculation until it is superseded by another is the authority, and the
  compulsory authority, for the crest which is to be borne. In Germany the
  crest has an infinitely greater importance than is the case with
  ourselves, but it is there considered in a large degree a territorial
  appanage, and it is by no means unusual in a German achievement to see
  several crests surmounting a single coat of arms. In England the Royal
  coat of arms has really three crests, although the crests of Scotland and
  Ireland are seldom used, which, it may be noted, are all in a manner
  territorial; but the difference of idea with which crests are regarded in
  Germany may be gathered from the fact that the King of Saxony has five,
  the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin five, the Grand Duke of
  Saxe-Meiningen six, the Grand Duke of Saxe-Altenburg seven, the Duke of
  Anhalt seven, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha six, the Prince of
  Schwartzburg-Sondershausen six, the Prince of Schwartzburg-Rudolstadt
  six, the Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont five, the Prince of Lippe five, the
  Duke of Brunswick five, and instances can be quoted of sixteen and
  seventeen. Probably Woodward is correct when he says that each crest
  formerly denoted a noble fief, for which the proprietor had a right to
  vote in the "circles" of the Empire, and he instances the Margraves of
  Brandenburg-Anspach, who were entitled to no less than thirteen crests.
  In France the use of crests is not nearly so general as in England or
  Germany. In Spain and Portugal it is less frequent still, and in Italy
  the use of a crest is the exception.</p>

  <p>The German practice of using horns on either side of the crest, which
  the ignorance of English heralds has transformed into the proboscides of
  elephants, is dealt with at some length on page <a
  href="#page214">214</a>. The horns, which are termed buffalo's or bull's
  horns until the middle of the thirteenth century, were short and
  thick-set. It is difficult to <!-- Page 344 --><span class="pagenum" title="390.png"
  ><a name="page344"></a>{344}</span>say at what date these figures came to
  be considered as heraldic <i>crests</i>, for as mere helmet ornaments
  they probably can be traced back very far beyond any proof of the
  existence of armory. In the fourteenth century we find the horns curved
  inwards like a sickle, but later the horns are found more erect, the
  points turning outwards, slimmer in shape, and finally they exhibit a
  decidedly marked double curve. Then the ends of the horns are met with
  open, like a trumpet, the fact which gave rise to the erroneous idea that
  they represented elephants' trunks. The horns became ornamented with
  feathers, banners, branches of leaves, balls, &amp;c., and the orifices
  garnished with similar adornments.</p>

  <p>In England, crests are theoretically subject to marks of cadency and
  difference. This is not the case, however, in any other country. In
  Germany, in cases where the crests reproduce the arms, any mark of
  cadency with which the arms are distinguished will of course be repeated;
  but in German heraldry, doubtless owing to the territorial nature of the
  crest, a change in the crest itself is often the only mark of distinction
  between different branches of the same family, and in Siebmacher's
  <i>Wappenbuch</i> thirty-one different branches of the Zorn family have
  different crests, which are the sole marks of difference in the
  achievements.</p>

  <p>But though British crests are presumed to be subject to the recognised
  marks of cadency, as a matter of fact it is very seldom indeed that they
  are ever so marked, with the exception that the mark used (usually a
  cross crosslet) to signify the lack of blood relationship when arms are
  assumed under a Royal License, is compulsory. Marks of distinction added
  to signify illegitimacy are also compulsory and perpetual. What these
  marks are will be dealt with in a subsequent chapter upon the subject.
  How very seldom a mark of difference is added to a crest may be gathered
  from the fact that with the exception of labels, chiefly upon the Royal
  crest, one crest only amongst the Plantagenet Garter plates is
  differenced, that one being the crest of John Neville, Lord Montague.
  Several crests, however, which are not Royal, are differenced by similar
  labels to those which appear upon the shields; but when we find that the
  difference marks have very much of a permissive character, even upon the
  shield, it is not likely that they are perpetuated upon the crest, where
  they are even less desirable. The arms of Cokayne, as given in the
  funeral certificate of Sir William Cokayne, Lord Mayor of London, show
  upon the shield three crescents, sable, or, and gules, charged one upon
  the other, the Lord Mayor being the second son of a second son of Cokayne
  of Sturston, descending from William, second son of Sir John Cokayne of
  Ashborne. But, in spite of the fact that three difference marks are
  charged upon the shield (one of the quarterings of which, by the way,
  <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum" title="391.png"><a
  name="page345"></a>{345}</span>has an additional mark), the crest itself
  is only differenced by one crescent. These difference marks, as applied
  to arms, are in England (the rules in Scotland are utterly distinct)
  practically permissive, and are never enforced against the wish of the
  bearer except in one circumstance. If, owing to the grant of a crest or
  supporters, or a Royal License, or any similar opportunity, a formal
  exemplification of the arms is entered on the books of the College of
  Arms, the opportunity is generally taken to add such mark of cadency as
  may be necessary; and no certificate would be officially issued to any
  one claiming arms through that exemplification except subject to the mark
  of cadency therein depicted. In such cases as these the crest is usually
  differenced, because the necessity for an exemplification does not often
  occur, except owing to the establishment of an important branch of the
  family, which is likely to continue as a separate house in the future,
  and possibly to rival the importance of the chief of the name. Two
  examples will show my meaning. The crest of the Duke of Bedford is a goat
  statant argent, armed or. When Earl Russell, the third son of the sixth
  Duke of Bedford, was so created, the arms, crest, and supporters were
  charged with a mullet argent. When the first Lord Ampthill, who was the
  third son of the father of the ninth Duke of Bedford, was so created, the
  arms of Russell, with the crest and supporters, were also charged with
  mullets, these being of different tinctures from those granted to Earl
  Russell. The crest of the Duke of Westminster is a talbot statant or. The
  first Lord Stalbridge was the second son of the Marquess of Westminster.
  His arms, crest, and supporters were charged with a crescent. Lord Ebury
  was the third son of the first Marquess of Westminster. His arms, crest,
  and supporters were charged with a mullet. In cases of this kind the mark
  of difference upon the crest would be considered permanent; but for
  ordinary purposes, and in ordinary circumstances, the rule may be taken
  to be that it is not necessary to add the mark of cadency to a crest,
  even when it is added to the shield, but that, at the same time, it is
  not incorrect to do so.</p>

  <p>Crests must nowadays always be depicted upon either a wreath, coronet,
  or chapeau; but these, and the rules concerning them, will be considered
  in a more definite and detailed manner in the separate chapters in which
  those objects are discussed.</p>

  <p>Crests are nowadays very frequently used upon livery buttons. Such a
  usage is discussed at some length in the chapter on badges.</p>

  <p>When two or more crests are depicted together, and when, as is often
  the case in England, the wreaths are depicted in space, and without the
  intervening helmets, the crests always all face to the dexter side, and
  the stereotyped character of English crests perhaps more than any other
  reason, has led of late to the depicting of English <!-- Page 346
  --><span class="pagenum" title="392.png"><a
  name="page346"></a>{346}</span>helmets all placed to face in the same
  direction to the dexter side. But if, as will often be found, the two
  helmets are turned to face each other, the crests also must be
  turned.</p>

  <p>Where there are two crests, the one on the dexter side is the first
  and the one on the sinister side is the second. When there are three, the
  centre one comes first, then the one on the dexter side, then the one on
  the sinister. When there are four crests, the first one is the dexter of
  the two inner ones; the second is the sinister inner one; the third is
  the dexter outer, and the fourth the sinister outer. When there are five
  (and I know of no greater number in this country), they run as follows:
  (1) centre, (2) dexter inner, (3) sinister inner, (4) dexter outer, (5)
  sinister outer.</p>

  <p>A very usual practice in official emblazonments in cases of three
  crests is to paint the centre one of a larger size, and at a slightly
  lower level, than the others. In the case of four, Nos. 1 and 2 would be
  of the same size, Nos. 3 and 4 slightly smaller, and slightly raised.</p>

  <p>It is a very usual circumstance to see two or more crests displayed in
  England, but this practice is of comparatively recent date. How recent
  may be gathered from the fact that in Scotland no single instance can be
  found before the year 1809 in which two crests are placed above the same
  shield. Scottish heraldry, however, has always been purer than English,
  and the practice in England is much more ancient, though I question if in
  England any authentic official exemplification can be found before 1700.
  There are, however, many cases in the Visitation Books in which two
  crests are allowed to the same family, but this fact does not prove the
  point, because a Visitation record is merely an official record of
  inheritance and possession, and not necessarily evidence of a regulation
  permitting the simultaneous display of more than one. It is of course
  impossible to use two sets of supporters with a single shield, but there
  are many peers who are entitled to two sets; Lord Ancaster, I believe, is
  entitled to three sets. But an official record in such a case would
  probably emblazon both sets as evidence of right, by painting the shield
  twice over.</p>

  <p>During the eighteenth century we find many instances of the grant of
  additional crests of augmentation, and many exemplifications under Royal
  License for the use of two and three crests. Since that day the
  correctness of duplicate crests has never been questioned, where the
  right of inheritance to them has been established. The right of
  inheritance to two or more crests at the present time is only officially
  allowed in the following cases.</p>

  <p>If a family at the time of the Visitations had two crests recorded to
  them, these would be now allowed. If descent can be proved from a family
  to whom a certain crest was allowed, and also from ancestors <!-- Page
  347 --><span class="pagenum" title="393.png"><a
  name="page347"></a>{347}</span>at an earlier date who are recorded as
  entitled to bear a different crest, the two would be allowed unless it
  was evident that the later crest had been granted, assigned, or
  exemplified <i>in lieu</i> of the earlier one. Two crests are allowed in
  the few cases which exist where a family has obtained a grant of arms in
  ignorance of the fact that they were then entitled to bear arms and crest
  of an earlier date to which the right has been subsequently proved, but
  on this point it should be remarked that if a right to arms is known to
  exist a second grant in England is point-blank refused unless the
  petition asks for it to be borne instead of, and in lieu of, the earlier
  one: it is then granted in those terms.</p>

  <p>To those who think that the Heralds' College is a mere fee-grabbing
  institution, the following experience of an intimate friend of mine may
  be of interest. In placing his pedigree upon record it became evident
  that his descent was not legitimate, and he therefore petitioned for and
  obtained a Royal License to bear the name and arms of the family from
  which he had sprung. But the illegitimacy was not modern, and no one
  would have questioned his right to the name which all the other members
  of the family bear, if he had not himself raised the point in order to
  obtain the ancient arms in the necessarily differenced form. The arms had
  always been borne with some four or five quarterings and with two crests,
  and he was rather annoyed that he had to go back to a simple coat of arms
  and single crest. He obtained a grant for his wife, who was an heiress,
  and then, with the idea of obtaining an additional quartering and a
  second crest, he conceived the brilliant idea&mdash;for money was of no
  object to him&mdash;of putting his brother forward as a petitioner for
  arms to be granted to him and his descendants and to the other
  descendants of his father, a grant which would of course have brought in
  my friend. He moved heaven and earth to bring this about, but he was met
  with the direct statement that two grants of arms could not be made to
  the same man to be borne simultaneously, and that if he persisted in the
  grant of arms to his brother, his own name, as being then entitled to
  bear arms, would be specifically exempted from the later grant, and the
  result was that this second grant was never made.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, where re-matriculation is constantly going on, two
  separate matriculations <i>to the same line</i> would not confer the
  right to two crests, inasmuch as the last matriculation supersedes
  everything which has preceded it. But if a cadet matriculates a different
  crest, <i>and subsequently</i> succeeds to the representation under an
  earlier matriculation, he legally succeeds to both crests, and
  incidentally to both coats of arms. As a matter of ordinary practice, the
  cadet matriculation is discarded. A curious case, however, occurs when
  after <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum" title="394.png"><a
  name="page348"></a>{348}</span>matriculation by a cadet there is a
  <i>later</i> matriculation behind it, by some one nearer the head of the
  house to which the first-mentioned cadet succeeds; in which event
  selection must be brought into play, when succession to both occurs. But
  the selection lies only between the two patents, and not from varied
  constituent parts.</p>

  <p>Where as an augmentation an additional crest is granted, as has been
  the case in many instances, of course a right to the double crest is
  thereby conferred, and a crest of augmentation is not granted in lieu,
  but in addition.</p>

  <p>A large number of these additional crests have been granted under
  specific warrants from the Crown, and in the case of Lord Gough, two
  additional crests were granted as separate augmentations and under
  separate patents. Lord Kitchener recently received a grant of an
  additional crest of augmentation. There are also a number of grants on
  record, not officially ranking as augmentations, in which a second crest
  has been granted as a memorial of descent or office, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The other cases in which double and treble crests occur are the
  results of exemplifications following upon Royal Licenses to assume name
  and arms. As a rule, when an additional surname is adopted by Royal
  License, the rule is that the arms adopted are to be borne in addition to
  those previously in existence; and where one name is adopted instead of
  another the warrant very frequently permits this, and at the same time
  permits or requires the new arms to be borne quarterly with those
  previously possessed, and gives the right to two crests. But in cases
  where names and arms are assumed by Royal License the arms and crest or
  crests are in accordance with the patent of exemplification, which, no
  matter what its terms (for some do not expressly exclude any prior
  rights), is always presumed to supersede everything which has gone
  before, and to be the authority by which the subsequent bearing of arms
  is regularised and controlled. Roughly speaking, under a Royal License
  one generally gets the right to one crest for every surname, and if the
  original surname be discarded, in addition a crest for every previous
  surname. Thus Mainwaring-Ellerker-Onslow has three crests,
  Wyndham-Campbell-Pleydell-Bouverie has four, and the last Duke of
  Buckingham and Chandos, who held the record, had one for each of his
  surnames, namely, Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville. In addition to
  the foregoing, there are one or two exceptions which it is difficult to
  explain. The Marquess of Bute for some reason or other obtained a grant,
  in the year 1822, of the crest of Herbert. The original Lord Liverpool
  obtained a grant of an additional crest, possibly an augmentation, and
  his representative, Lord Hawkesbury, afterwards created Earl of
  Liverpool, for some reason or other which I am quite at a loss to
  understand, obtained a grant of a crest <!-- Page 349 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="395.png"><a name="page349"></a>{349}</span>very
  similar to that of Lord Liverpool to commemorate the representation which
  had devolved upon him. He subsequently obtained a grant of a third crest,
  this last being of augmentation. Sir Charles Young, Garter King of Arms,
  obtained the grant of a second crest, and a former Marquess of Camden did
  the same thing; Lord Swansea is another recent case, and though the right
  of any person to obtain the grant of a second crest is not officially
  admitted, and is in fact strenuously denied, I cannot for the life of me
  see how in the face of the foregoing precedents any such privilege can be
  denied. Sir William Woods also obtained the grant of a second crest when
  he was Garter, oblivious of the fact that he had not really established a
  right to arms. Those he used were certainly granted in Lyon Office to a
  relative, but no matriculation of them in his own name was ever
  registered. <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum" title="396.png"><a

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXII</h5>

<h5>CROWNS AND CORONETS</h5>

  <p>The origin of the crown or coronet is, of course, to be met with in
  the diadem and fillet. In one of the Cantor Lectures delivered by Mr.
  Cyril Davenport, F.S.A., in February 1902, on "The History of Personal
  Jewellery from Prehistoric Times," he devoted considerable attention to
  the development of the diadem, and the following extracts are from the
  printed report of his lecture:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The bandeau or fillet tied round the head was probably first used to
  keep long hair from getting into the eyes of primitive man. Presently it
  became specialised, priests wearing one pattern and fighting men
  another.</p>

  <p>"The soft band which can be seen figured on the heads of kings in
  early coins, is no doubt a mark of chieftainship. This use of a band, of
  special colour, to indicate authority, probably originated in the East.
  It was adopted by Alexander the Great, who also used the diadem of the
  King of Persia. Justinian says that Alexander's predecessors did not wear
  any diadem. Justinian also tells us that the diadems then worn were of
  some soft material, as in describing the accidental wounding of
  Lysimachus by Alexander, he says that the hurt was bound up by Alexander
  <i>with his own diadem</i>. This was considered a lucky omen for
  Lysimachus, who actually did shortly afterwards become King of
  Thrace.</p>

  <p>"In Egypt diadems of particular shape are of very ancient use. There
  were crowns for Upper and Lower Egypt, and a combination of both for the
  whole country. They were also distinguished by colour. The Uraeus or
  snake worn in the crowns and head-dresses of the Pharaohs was a symbol of
  royalty. Representations of the Egyptian gods always show them as wearing
  crowns.</p>

  <p>"In Assyrian sculptures deities and kings are shown wearing diadems,
  apparently bands of stuff or leather studded with discs of
  <i>repoussé</i> work. Some of these discs, detached, have actually been
  found. Similar discs were plentifully found at Mycenæ, which were very
  likely used in a similar way. Some of the larger ornamental head-dresses
  worn by Assyrian kings appear to have been conical-shaped helmets, or
  perhaps crowns; it is now difficult to say which, <!-- Page 351 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="397.png"><a name="page351"></a>{351}</span>because
  the material of which they were made cannot be ascertained. If they were
  of gold, they were probably crowns, like the wonderful openwork golden
  Scythian head-dress found at Kertch, but if of an inferior metal they may
  have been only helmets.</p>

  <p>"At St. Petersburg there is a beautiful ancient Greek diadem
  representing a crown of olive. An Etruscan ivy wreath of thin gold, still
  encircling a bronze helmet, is in the British Museum.</p>

  <p>"Justinian says that Morimus tried to hang himself with the diadem,
  evidently a ribbon-like bandeau, sent to him by Mithridates. The Roman
  royal diadem was originally a white ribbon, a wreath of laurel was the
  reward of distinguished citizens, while a circlet of golden leaves was
  given to successful generals.</p>

  <p>"Cæsar consistently refused the royal white diadem which Antony
  offered him, preferring to remain perpetual dictator. One of his
  partisans ventured to crown Cæsar's bust with a coronet of laurel tied
  with royal white ribbon, but the tribunes quickly removed it and heavily
  punished the perpetrator of the offence.</p>

  <p>"During the Roman Empire the prejudice against the white bandeau
  remained strong. The emperors dared not wear it. Caligula wished to do
  so, but was dissuaded on being told that such a proceeding might cost his
  life. Eliogabalus used to wear a diadem studded with precious stones, but
  it is not supposed to have indicated rank, but only to have been a rich
  lady's parure, this emperor being fond of dressing himself up as a woman.
  Caracalla, who took Alexander the Great as his model as far as possible,
  is shown on some of his coins wearing a diadem of a double row of pearls,
  a similar design to which was used by the kings of Parthia. On coins of
  Diocletian, there shows a double row of pearls, sewn on a double band and
  tied in a knot at the back.</p>

  <p>"Diadems gradually closed in and became crowns, and on Byzantine coins
  highly ornate diadems can be recognised, and there are many beautiful
  representations of them in enamels and mosaics, as well as a few actual
  specimens. At Ravenna, in mosaic work in the church of San Vitale, are
  crowned portraits of Justinian and his Empress Theodosia; in the enamel
  portrait of the Empress Irene in the Pal d'Oro at Venice, can be seen a
  beautiful jewelled crown with hinged plaques, and the same construction
  is used on the iron crown of Lombardy, the sacred crown of Hungary, and
  the crown of Charlemagne, all most beautiful specimens of jewellers'
  work.</p>

  <p>"On the plaques of the crown of Constantine Monomachos are also fine
  enamel portraits of himself and his queen Zoë, wearing similar crowns.
  The cataseistas, or jewelled chains, one over each ear and one at the
  back, which occur on all these crowns, may be the survival of the loose
  ends of the tie of the original fillet. <!-- Page 352 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="398.png"><a name="page352"></a>{352}</span></p>

  <p>"In later times of Greece and Rome, owing to the growth of republican
  feeling the diadem lost its political significance, and was relegated to
  the ladies.</p>

  <p>"In the Middle Ages the diadem regained much of its earlier
  significance, and ceased to be only the simple head ornament it had
  become. Now it became specialised in form, reserved as an emblem of rank.
  The forms of royal crowns and diadems is a large and fascinating study,
  and where original examples do not now exist, the development can often
  be followed in sculpture, coins, or seals. Heraldry now plays an
  important part. Diadems or circlets gradually give way to closed crowns,
  in the case of sovereigns possessing independent authority."</p>

  <p>But to pass to the crown proper, there is no doubt that from the
  earliest times of recorded history crowns have been a sign and emblem of
  sovereignty. It equally admits of no doubt that the use of a crown or
  coronet was by no means exclusive to a sovereign, but whilst our
  knowledge is somewhat curtailed as to the exact relation in which great
  overlords and nobles stood to their sovereign, it is difficult to draw
  with any certainty or exactitude definitive conclusions of the symbolism
  a crown or coronet conveyed. Throughout Europe in the eleventh, twelfth,
  and thirteenth, and well into the fourteenth centuries, the great
  territorial lords enjoyed and exercised many&mdash;in fact most&mdash;of
  the attributes of sovereignty, and in England especially, where the king
  was no more than the first amongst his peers, the territorial earls were
  in much the position of petty sovereigns. It is only natural, therefore,
  that we should find them using this emblem of sovereignty. But what we do
  find in England is that a coronet or fillet was used, apparently without
  let or hindrance, by even knights. It is, however, a matter for thought
  as to whether many of these fillets were not simply the turban or
  "puggaree" folded into the shape of a fillet, but capable of being
  unrolled if desired. What the object of the wholesale wearing of crowns
  and coronets was, it is difficult to conjecture.</p>

  <p>The development of the crown of the English sovereigns has been best
  told by Mr. Cyril Davenport in his valuable work on "The English Regalia"
  (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co.). Mr. Davenport, whose knowledge
  on these matters is probably unequalled, may best be allowed to tell the
  story in his own words, he and his publishers having very kindly
  permitted this course to be taken:&mdash; <!-- Page 353 --><span

<h5>THE CROWN OF GREAT BRITAIN</h5>

<h5 class="sm"><span class="sc">By Cyril Davenport</span>, F.S.A.</h5>

  <p>"Crowns appear to have been at an early period worn by kings in
  battle, in order that they might be easily recognised; and although it is
  quite possible that this outward sign of sovereignty may have marked the
  wearer as being entitled to special protection by his own men, it is also
  likely that it was often a dangerous sign of importance. Upon the
  authority of their coins, the heads of the early British kings were
  adorned with variously formed fillets and ornamental wreaths. Helmets are
  also evidently intended to be shown, and on some of the coins of
  Athelstan the helmet bears upon it a crown of three raised points, with a
  single pearl at the top of each (Fig. 619). Other coins bear the crown
  with the three raised points without the helmet (Fig. 620). This crown of
  three points, bearing sometimes one and sometimes three pearls at the top
  of each, continued to be used by all the sole monarchs until Canute, on
  whose head a crown is shown in which the three points develop into three
  clearly-marked trefoils (Fig. 621). On the great seal of Edward the
  Confessor the king is wearing an ornamental cap, which is described by
  Mr. Wyon in his book about the Great Seals as bearing a crown with three
  points trefoiled; but the impressions of this Great Seal that I have been
  able to see are so indistinct in this particular that I do not feel
  justified in corroborating his opinion. On some of the coins, however, of
  Edward the Confessor, an arched crown is very clearly shown, and this
  crown has depending from it, on each side, tassels with ornamental ends
  (Fig. 622).</p>

  <p>"In the list of the English regalia which were destroyed under the
  Commonwealth in 1649 is found an item of great interest, viz. 'a gold
  wyer work crown with little bells,' which is there stated to have
  belonged to King Alfred, who appears to have been the first English king
  for whom the ceremony of coronation was used; and it is remarkable that
  on several of the crowns on coins and seals, from the time of Edward the
  Confessor until Henry I., little tassels or tags are shown which may
  indeed represent little bells suspended by a ribbon.</p>

  <p>"On King Alfred's own coins there is unfortunately nothing which can
  be recognised as a crown. <!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum" title="400.png"

  coins a more ornamental form of crown occurs having a broad jewelled rim
  and two arches, also apparently jewelled, and at each side are two

  <p>"On the first Great Seal of Henry III. a crown with three
  fleurs-de-lis is shown surmounting a barred helmet (Fig. 629), and Edward
  I. wore a similar crown with three fleurs-de-lis, but having
  supplementary pearls between each (Fig. 630), and this form lasted for a
  long time, as modifications of it are found on the coins of all the kings
  till Henry VII. On the third Great Seal of Edward IV. the king wears a
  crown with five fleurs-de-lis, the centre one being larger than the
  others, and the crown is arched and has at the top an orb and cross (Fig.
  631). Henry VI. on his first seal for foreign affairs, on which occurs
  the English shield, uses above it a crown with three crosses-patée and
  between each a pearl (Fig. 632), this being the first distinct use of the
  cross-patée on the English crown; and it probably was used here in place
  of the fleurs-de-lis hitherto worn in order to <!-- Page 355 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="401.png"><a name="page355"></a>{355}</span>make a
  clear distinction between it and the French crown, which has the

  <p>"Henry VII. on his Great Seal uses as ornaments for the crown,
  crosses-patée alternately with fleurs-de-lis, and also arches with an orb
  and cross at the top (Fig. 633) and, on some of his coins, he reverts to
  the three fleurs-de-lis with points between them, arches being still
  used, with the orb and cross at the top (Fig. 634). An ornamental form of
  crown bearing five ornamental leaves alternately large and small, with
  arches, orb, and cross at the top (Fig. 635), occurs on the shillings of
  Henry VII. On the crowns of Henry VIII., as well as upon his Great Seals,
  the alternate crosses-patée and fleurs-de-lis are found on the rim of the
  crown, which is arched, and has an orb and cross at the top, and this is
  the form that has remained ever since (Fig. 636). So we may consider that
  the growth of the ornament on the rim of the crown has followed a regular
  sequence from the points with one pearl at the top, of Æthelstan, to the
  trefoil of Canute; the arches began with Edward the Confessor, and the
  centre trefoil turned into the cross-patée of Henry VI. The fact that the
  remaining trefoils turned eventually into fleurs-de-lis is only, I think,
  a natural expansion of form, and does not appear to have had anything to
  do with the French fleur-de-lis, which was adopted as an heraldic bearing
  for an entirely different reason. The Royal coat of arms of England did
  bear for a long time in one of its quarterings the actual fleurs-de-lis
  of France, and this, no doubt, has given some reason to the idea that the
  fleurs-de-lis on the crown had also something to do with France; but as a
  matter of fact they had existed on the crown of England long anterior to
  our use of them on the coat of arms, as well as remaining there
  subsequently to their discontinuance on our Royal escutcheon.</p>

  <p>"The cross-patée itself may possibly have been evolved in a somewhat
  similar way from the three pearls of William I., as we often find the
  centre trefoil, into which, as we have seen, these three points
  eventually <!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum" title="402.png"><a
  name="page356"></a>{356}</span>turned, has a tendency to become larger
  than the others, and this difference has been easily made more apparent
  by squaring the ends of the triple leaf. At the same time it must not be
  forgotten that the cross-patée was actually used on the sceptre of Edward
  the Confessor, so it is just possible it may have had some specially
  English significance.</p>

  <p>"I have already mentioned that as well as the official crown of
  England, which alone I have just been describing, there has often been a
  second or State crown, and this, although it has in general design
  followed the pattern of the official crown, has been much more
  elaborately ornamented, and in it has been set and reset the few historic
  gems possessed by our nation. The fact that these State crowns have in
  turn been denuded of their jewels accounts for the fact that the old
  settings of some of them still exist.</p>

  <p>"Charles II.'s State Crown is figured in Sir Edward Walker's account
  of his coronation, but the illustration of it is of such an elementary
  character that little reliance can be placed on it; the actual setting of
  this crown, however&mdash;which was the one stolen by Colonel Blood on
  May 13, 1671&mdash;is now the property of Lord Amherst of Hackney, and
  the spaces from which the great ruby and the large sapphire&mdash;both of
  which are now in King Edward's State crown&mdash;have been taken are
  clearly seen (Fig. 637). James II.'s State Crown, which is very
  accurately figured in Sandford's account of his coronation, and pieces of
  which are still in the Tower, also had this great ruby as its centre
  ornament (Fig. 638). In Sir George Nayler's account of the coronation of
  George IV. there is a figure of his so-called 'new crown,' the arches of
  which are composed of oak-leaf sprays with acorns, and the rim adorned
  with laurel sprays (Fig. 639). The setting of this crown also belongs to
  Lord Amherst of Hackney, and so does another setting of a small State
  queen's crown, the ownership of which is doubtful. William IV. appears to
  have had a very beautiful State crown, with arches of laurel sprays and a
  cross at the top with large diamonds. It is figured in Robson's 'British
  Herald,' published in 1830 (Fig. 640).</p>

  England, forms part of our regalia. This is the crown of Scotland, and is
  the most ancient piece of State jewellery of which we can boast.</p>

  <p>"Edward I., after his defeat of John Baliol in 1296, carried off the
  crown of Scotland to England, and Robert Bruce had another made for
  himself. This in its turn, after Bruce's defeat at Methven, fell into
  Edward's hands. Another crown seems to have been made for Bruce in 1314,
  when he was established in the sovereignty of Scotland after Bannockburn,
  and the present crown probably consists largely of the material of the
  old one, and most likely follows its general design. It has, however,
  much French work about it, as well as the rougher gold work made by
  Scottish jewellers, and it seems probable that the crown, as it now is,
  is a reconstruction by French workmen, made under the care and by order
  of James V. about 1540. It was with this crown that Queen Mary was
  crowned when she was nine months old.</p>

  <p>"In 1661 the Scottish regalia were considered to be in danger from the
  English, and were sent to Dunnottar Castle for safety. From 1707 until
  1818 they were locked up in a strong chest in the Crown-Room of Edinburgh
  Castle, and Sir Walter Scott, in whose presence the box was opened, wrote
  an account of them in 1810. The crown consists of a fillet of gold
  bordered with flat wire. Upon it are twenty-two large stones set at equal
  distances, <i>i.e.</i> nine carbuncles, four jacinths, four amethysts,
  two white topazes, two crystals with green foil behind them, and one
  topaz with yellow foil. Behind each of these gems is a gold plate, with
  bands above and below of white enamel with black spots, and between each
  stone is a pearl. Above the band are ten jewelled rosettes and ten
  fleurs-de-lis alternately, and between each a pearl. Under the rosettes
  and fleurs-de-lis are jewels of blue enamel and pearls alternately. The
  arches have enamelled leaves of French work in red and gold upon them,
  and the mount at the top is of blue enamel studded with gold stars. The
  cross at the top is black enamel with gold arabesque patterns; in the
  centre is an amethyst, and in this cross and in the corners are Oriental
  pearls set in gold. At the back of the cross are the letters I. R. V. in
  enamel-work. On the velvet cap are four large pearls in settings of gold
  and enamel (Fig. 641).</p>

  <p>"Generally, the Scottish work in gold is cast solid and chased, the
  foreign work being thinner and <i>repoussé</i>. Several of the diamonds
  are undoubtedly old, and are cut in the ancient Oriental fashion; and
  many of the pearls are Scottish. It is kept in Edinburgh Castle with the
  rest of the Scottish regalia. None of the other pieces at all equal it in
  interest, as with the exception of the coronation ring of Charles I. <!--

  <p>Very few people are aware, when they speak of the crown of England,
  that there are two crowns. The one is the official crown, the sign and
  symbol of the sovereigns of England. This is known by the name of St.
  Edward's Crown, and is never altered or changed. As to this Mr. Cyril
  Davenport writes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"St. Edward's crown was made for the coronation of Charles II. in
  1662, by Sir Robert Vyner. It was ordered to be made as nearly as
  possible after the old pattern, and the designs of it that have been
  already mentioned as existing in the works of Sir Edward Walker and
  Francis Sandford show that in a sensual form it was the same as now;
  indeed, the existing crown is in all probability mainly composed of the
  same materials as that made by Sir Robert. The crown consists of a rim or
  circlet of gold, adorned with rosettes of precious stones surrounded with
  diamonds, and set upon enamel arabesques of white and red. The centre
  gems of these rosettes are rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. Rows of large
  pearls mark the upper and lower edges of the rim, from which rise the
  four crosses-patée and four fleurs-de-lis alternately, adorned with
  diamonds and other gems. The gem clusters upon the crosses are set upon
  enamel arabesques in white and red, of similar workmanship to that upon
  the rim. From the tops of the crosses rise two complete arches of gold
  crossing each other, and curving deeply downwards at the point of
  intersection. The arches are considered to be the mark of independent
  sovereignty. They are edged with rows of large pearls, and have gems and
  clusters of gems upon them set in arabesques of red and white, like those
  upon the crosses. From the intersection of the arches springs a mound of
  gold, encircled by a fillet from which rises a single arch, both of which
  are ornamented with pearls and gems. On the top of the arch is a
  cross-patée of gold, set in which are coloured gems and diamonds. At the
  top of the cross is a large spheroidal pearl, and from each of the side
  arms, depending from a little gold bracelet, is a beautifully formed
  pear-shaped pearl. The crown is shown in the Tower with the crimson
  velvet cap, turned up with miniver, which would be worn with it.</p>

  <p>"This crown is very large, but whether it is actually worn or not it
  would always be present at the coronation, as it is the 'official' crown
  of England."</p>

  <p>St. Edward's crown is the crown supposed to be heraldically
  represented when for State or official purposes the crown is represented
  over the Royal Arms or other insignia. In this the fleurs-de-lis upon the
  rim are only half fleurs-de-lis. This detail is scrupulously adhered to,
  but during the reign of Queen Victoria many of the other details <!--
  Page 359 --><span class="pagenum" title="405.png"><a
  name="page359"></a>{359}</span>were very much "at the mercy" of the
  artist. Soon after the accession of King Edward VII. the matter was
  brought under consideration, and the opportunity afforded by the issue of
  a War Office Sealed Pattern of the Royal Crown and Cypher for use in the
  army was taken advantage of to notify his Majesty's pleasure, that for
  official purposes the Royal Crown should be as shown in Fig. 642, which
  is a reproduction of the War Office Sealed Pattern already mentioned. It
  should be noted that whilst the cap of the real crown is of <i>purple</i>
  velvet, the cap of the <i>heraldic</i> crown is <i>always</i> represented
  as of crimson.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The second crown is what is known as the "Imperial State Crown." This
  is the one which is actually worn, and which the Sovereign after the
  ceremony of his coronation wears in the procession from the Abbey. It is
  also carried before the Sovereign at the opening of Parliament. Whilst
  the gems which are set in it are national property, the crown is usually
  remade for each successive sovereign. The following is Mr. Davenport's
  description of Queen Victoria's State Crown:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This beautiful piece of jewellery was made by Roundell &amp; Bridge
  in 1838. Many of the gems in it are old ones reset, and many of them are
  new. The entire weight of the crown is 39 ozs. 5 dwts. It consists of a
  circlet of open work in silver, bearing in the front the great sapphire
  from the crown of Charles II. which was bequeathed to George III. by
  Cardinal York, with other Stuart treasure. At one end this gem is partly
  pierced. It is not a thick stone, but it is a fine colour. Opposite to
  the large sapphire is one of smaller size. The remainder of the rim is
  filled in with rich jewel clusters having alternately sapphires and
  emeralds in their centres, enclosed in ornamental borders thickly set
  with diamonds. These clusters are separated from each other by trefoil
  designs also thickly set with diamonds. The rim is bordered above and
  below with bands of large pearls, 129 in the lower row, and 112 in the
  upper. [The crown as remade for King Edward VII. now has 139 pearls in
  the lower row, and 122 in the upper.] Above the rim are shallow festoons
  of diamonds caught up between the larger ornaments by points of emeralds
  encircled with diamonds, and a large pearl above each. On these festoons
  are set alternately eight crosses-patée, and eight fleurs-de-lis of
  silver set with gems. The crosses-patée are thickly set with brilliants,
  and have each an emerald in the centre, except that in front of the
  crown, which <!-- Page 360 --><span class="pagenum" title="406.png"><a
  name="page360"></a>{360}</span>contains the most remarkable jewel
  belonging to the regalia. This is a large spinal ruby of irregular
  drop-like form, measuring about 2 ins. in length, and is highly polished
  on what is probably its natural surface, or nearly so. Its irregular
  outline makes it possible to recognise the place that it has formerly
  occupied in the older State crowns, and it seems always to have been
  given the place of honour. It is pierced after an Oriental fashion, and
  the top of the piercing is filled with a supplementary ruby set in gold.
  Don Pedro, King of Castille in 1367, murdered the King of Granada for the
  sake of his jewels, one of which was this stone, and Don Pedro is said to
  have given it to Edward the Black Prince after the battle of Najera, near
  Vittoria, in the same year. After this, it is said to have been worn by
  Henry V. in his crown at Agincourt in 1415, when it is recorded that the
  King's life was saved from the attack of the Duc D'Alençon, because of
  the protection afforded him by his crown, a portion of which, however,
  was broken off. It may be confidently predicted that such a risk of
  destruction is not very likely to happen again to the great ruby.</p>

  <p>"In the centre of each of the very ornamental fleurs-de-lis is a ruby,
  and all the rest of the ornamentation on them is composed of rose
  diamonds, large and small. From each of the crosses-patée, the upper
  corners of which have each a large pearl upon them, rises an arch of
  silver worked into a design of oak-leaves and acorn-cups. These leaves
  and cups are all closely encrusted with a mass of large and small
  diamonds, rose brilliant, and table-cut; the acorns themselves formed of
  beautiful drop-shaped pearls of large size. From the four points of
  intersection of the arches at the top of the crown depend large
  egg-shaped pearls. From the centre of the arches, which slope slightly
  downwards, springs a mound with a cross-patée above it. The mound is
  ornamented all over with close lines of brilliant diamonds, and the
  fillet which encircles it, and the arch which crosses over it, are both
  ornamented with one line of large rose-cut diamonds set closely together.
  The cross-patée at the top has in the centre a large sapphire of
  magnificent colour set openly. The outer lines of the arms of the cross
  are marked by a row of small diamonds close together and in the centre of
  each arm is a large diamond, the remaining spaces being filled with more
  small diamonds. The large sapphire in the centre of this cross is said to
  have come out of the ring of Edward the Confessor, which was buried with
  him in his shrine at Westminster, and the possession of it is supposed to
  give to the owner the power of curing the cramp. If this be indeed the
  stone which belonged to St. Edward, it was probably recut in its present
  form of a 'rose' for Charles II., even if not since his time.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    643.</span>&mdash;Queen Alexandra's Coronation Crown.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"Not counting the large ruby or the large sapphire, this crown <!--
  Page 361 --><span class="pagenum" title="409.png"><a
  name="page361"></a>{361}</span>contains: Four rubies, eleven emeralds,
  sixteen sapphires, 277 pearls, 2783 diamonds. [As remade for King Edward
  VII. the crown now has 297 pearls and 2818 diamonds.]</p>

  <p>"The large ruby has been valued at £110,000.</p>

  <p>"When this crown has to take a journey it is provided with a little
  casket, lined with white velvet, and having a sliding drawer at the
  bottom, with a boss on which the crown fits closely, so that it is safe
  from slipping. The velvet cap turned up with miniver, with which it is
  worn, is kept with it."</p>

  <p>This crown has been recently remade for King Edward VII., but has not
  been altered in any essential details. The cap of the real crown is of
  purple velvet.</p>

  <p>Fig. 643 represents the crown of the Queen Consort with which Queen
  Alexandra was crowned on August 9, 1902. It will be noticed that, unlike
  the King's crowns, this has eight arches. The circlet which forms the
  base is 1½ inches in height. The crown is entirely composed of diamonds,
  of which there are 3972, and these are placed so closely together that no
  metal remains visible. The large diamond visible in the illustration is
  the famous Koh-i-noor. Resting upon the rim are four crosses-patée, and
  as many fleurs-de-lis, from each of which springs an arch. As a matter of
  actual fact the crown was made for use on this one occasion and has since
  been broken up.</p>

  <p>There is yet another crown, probably the one with which we are most
  familiar. This is a small crown entirely composed of diamonds: and the
  earliest heraldic use which can be found of it is in the design by Sir
  Edgar Boehm for the 1887 Jubilee coinage. Though effective enough when
  worn, it does not, from its small size, lend itself effectively to
  pictorial representation, and as will be remembered, the design of the
  1887 coinage was soon abandoned. This crown was made at the personal
  expense of Queen Victoria, and under her instructions, owing to the fact
  that her late Majesty found her "State" crown uncomfortable to wear, and
  too heavy for prolonged or general use. It is understood, also, that the
  Queen found the regulations concerning its custody both inconvenient and
  irritating. During the later part of her reign this smaller crown was the
  only one Queen Victoria ever wore. By her will the crown was settled as
  an heirloom upon Queen Alexandra, to devolve upon future Queens Consort
  for the time being. This being the case, it is not unlikely that in the
  future this crown may come to be regarded as a part of the national
  regalia, and it is as well, therefore, to reiterate the remark, that it
  was made at the personal expense of her late Majesty, and is to no extent
  and in no way the property of the nation. <!-- Page 362 --><span

  </div>

  <p>In spite of various Continental edicts, the heraldic use of coronets
  of rank, as also their actual use, seems elsewhere than in Great Britain
  to be governed by no such strict regulations as are laid down and
  conformed to in this country. For this reason, no less than for the
  greater interest these must necessarily possess for readers in this
  country, English coronets will first claim our attention. It has been
  already observed that coronets or jewelled fillets are to be found upon
  the helmets even of simple knights from the earliest periods. They
  probably served no more than decorative purposes, unless these fillets be
  merely turbans, or suggestions thereof. As late as the fifteenth century
  there appears to have been no regularised form, as will be seen from Fig.
  644, which represents the coronet as shown upon the effigy of Thomas
  FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, in Arundel Church (1415). A very similar
  coronet surmounts the head-dress of the effigy of Beatrice, Countess of
  Arundel, at the same period. In his will, Lionel, Duke of Clarence
  (1368), bequeaths "two golden circles," with one of which he was created
  Duke. It is of interest to compare this with Fig. 645, which represents
  the crown of King Henry IV. as represented on his effigy. Richard, Earl
  of Arundel, in his will (December 5, 1375), leaves his "melieure coronne"
  to his eldest son Richard, his "second melieure coronne" to his daughter
  Joan, and his "tierce coronne" to his daughter Alice. Though not definite
  proof of the point, the fact that the earl distributes his coronets
  amongst his family irrespective of the fact that the earldom (of which
  one would presume the coronets to be a sign) would pass to his son, would
  seem to show that the wearing of a coronet even at that date was merely
  indicative of high nobility of birth, and not of the possession of a
  substantive Parliamentary peerage. In spite of the variations <!-- Page
  363 --><span class="pagenum" title="411.png"><a
  name="page363"></a>{363}</span>in form, coronets were, however, a
  necessity. When both dukes and earls were created they were invested with
  a coronet in open Parliament. As time went on the coronet, however,
  gradually came to be considered the sign of the possession of a peerage,
  and was so borne; but it was not until the reign of Charles II. that
  coronets were definitely assigned by Royal Warrant (February 19, 1660) to
  peers not of the Blood Royal. Before this date a coronet had not (as has
  been already stated) been used heraldically or in fact by barons, who,
  both in armorial paintings and in Parliament, had used a plain crimson
  cap turned up with white fur.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    646.</span>&mdash;Coronet of the Prince of Wales.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The coronet of the Prince of Wales is exactly like the official (St.
  Edward's) crown, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has
  only one. An illustration of this is given in Fig. 646 (this being the
  usual form in which it is heraldically depicted). It should be noticed,
  however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the
  Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales. It
  was assigned by Royal Warrant 9th February, 13 Charles II. The coronet of
  the Princess of Wales, as such, is heraldically the same as that of her
  husband.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    647.</span>&mdash;Coronet of the younger children of the Sovereign.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The coronets of the sons and daughters or brothers and sisters of a
  sovereign of Great Britain (other than a Prince of Wales) is as in Fig.
  647, that is, the circlet being identical with that of the Royal Crown,
  and of the Prince of Wales' coronet, but without the arch. This was also
  assigned in the warrant of 9th February, 13 Charles II. Officially this
  coronet is described as being composed of crosses-patée and fleurs-de-lis
  alternately.</p>

  <p>The grandchildren of a sovereign being sons and daughters of the
  Prince of Wales, or of other sons of the sovereign, have a coronet in
  which strawberry leaves are substituted for the two outer crosses-patée
  appearing at the edges of the coronet, which is officially described as
  composed of crosses-patée, fleurs-de-lis, and strawberry leaves.</p>

  <p>Princes of the English Royal Family, being sons of younger sons of a
  sovereign, or else nephews of a sovereign being sons of brothers of a
  sovereign, and having the rank and title of a duke of the United Kingdom,
  have a coronet composed alternately of crosses-patée and strawberry
  leaves, the latter taking the place of the fleurs-de-lis upon <!-- Page
  364 --><span class="pagenum" title="412.png"><a
  name="page364"></a>{364}</span>the circlet of the Royal Crown. This
  coronet was also assigned in the warrant of 9th February, 13 Charles
  II.</p>

  <p>It will be observed by those who compare one heraldic book with
  another that I have quoted these rules differently from any other work
  upon the subject. A moment's thought, however, must convince any one of
  the accuracy of my version. It is a cardinal rule of armory that save for
  the single circumstance of attainder no man's armorial insignia shall be
  degraded. Whilst any man's status may be increased, it cannot be
  lessened. Most heraldic books quote the coronet of crosses-patée,
  fleurs-de-lis, and strawberry leaves as the coronet of the "grandsons" of
  the sovereign, whilst the coronet of crosses-patée and strawberry leaves
  is stated to be the coronet of "nephews" or cousins of the sovereign.
  Such a state of affairs would be intolerable, because it would mean the
  liability at any moment to be degraded to the use of a less honourable
  coronet. Take, for example, the case of Prince Arthur of Connaught.
  During the lifetime of Queen Victoria, as a grandson of the sovereign he
  would be entitled to the former, whereas as soon as King Edward ascended
  the throne he would have been forced to relinquish it in favour of the
  more remote form.</p>

  <p>The real truth is that the members of the Royal Family do not inherit
  these coronets as a matter of course. They technically and in fact have
  no coronets until these have been assigned by Royal Warrant with the
  arms. When such warrants are issued, the coronets assigned have up to the
  present time conformed to the above rules. I am not sure that the "rules"
  now exist in any more potent form than that up to the present time those
  particular patterns happen to have been assigned in the circumstances
  stated. But the warrants (though they contain no hereditary limitation)
  certainly contain no clause limiting their operation to the lifetime of
  the then sovereign, which they certainly would do if the coronet only
  existed whilst the particular relationship continued.</p>

  <p>The terms "grandson of the sovereign" and "nephew of the sovereign,"
  which are usually employed, are not correct. The coronets only apply to
  the children of <i>princes</i>. The children of princesses, who are
  undoubtedly included in the terms "grandson" and "nephew," are not
  technically members of the Royal Family, nor do they inherit either rank
  or coronet from their mothers.</p>

  <p>By a curious fatality there has never, since these Royal coronets were
  differentiated, been any male descendant of an English sovereign more
  remotely related than a nephew, with the exception of the Dukes of
  Cumberland. Their succession to the throne of Hanover renders them
  useless as a precedent, inasmuch as their right to arms and coronet must
  be derived from Hanover and its laws, and not <!-- Page 365 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="413.png"><a name="page365"></a>{365}</span>from
  this country. The Princess Frederica of Hanover, however, uses an English
  coronet and the Royal Arms of England, presumably preferring her status
  as a princess of this country to whatever <i>de jure</i> Hanoverian
  status might be claimed. It is much to be wished that a Royal Warrant
  should be issued to her which would decide the point&mdash;at present in
  doubt&mdash;as to what degree of relationship the coronet of the
  crosses-patée and strawberry leaves is available for, or failing that
  coronet what the coronet of prince or princess of this country might be,
  he or she not being child, grandchild, or nephew or niece of a
  sovereign.</p>

  <p>The unique use of actual coronets in England at the occasion of each
  coronation ceremony has prevented them becoming (as in so many other
  countries) mere pictured heraldic details. Consequently the instructions
  concerning them which are issued prior to each coronation will be of
  interest. The following is from the <i>London Gazette</i> of October 1,
  1901:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Coronation Robe of a peer is not identical with his Parliamentary
  Robe of Estate. This latter is of fine scarlet cloth, lined with taffeta.
  The distinction between the degrees of rank is effected by the guards or
  bands of fur. The robe of a duke has four guards of <i>ermine</i> at
  equal distances, with gold lace above each guard and tied up to the left
  shoulder by a white riband. The robe of a marquess has four guards of
  <i>ermine</i> on the right side, and three on the left, with gold lace
  above each guard and tied up to the left shoulder by a white riband. An
  earl's robe has three guards of ermine and gold lace. The robes of a
  viscount and baron are identical, each having two guards of plain
  <i>white</i> fur.</p>

  <p>By virtue of various warrants of Earls Marshal, duly recorded in the
  College of Arms, the use or display of a coronet of rank by any person
  other than a peer is stringently forbidden. This rule, unfortunately, is
  too often ignored by many eldest sons of peers, who use peerage titles by
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>The heraldic representations of these coronets of rank are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The coronet of a duke shows five strawberry leaves (Fig. 648). This
  coronet should not be confused with the ducal <i>crest</i> coronet.</p>

  <p>The coronet of a marquess shows two balls of silver technically known
  as "pearls," and three strawberry leaves (Fig. 649).</p>

  <p>The coronet of an earl shows five "pearls" raised on tall spikes,
  alternating with four strawberry leaves (Fig. 650). <!-- Page 368
  --><span class="pagenum" title="416.png"><a
  name="page368"></a>{368}</span></p>

  <p>The coronet of a viscount shows nine "pearls," all set closely
  together, directly upon the circlet (Fig. 651).</p>

  <p>The coronet of a baron shows four "pearls" upon the circlet (Fig.
  652). This coronet was assigned by Royal Warrant, dated 7th August, 12
  Charles II., to Barons of England, and to Barons of Ireland by warrant
  16th May, 5 James II.</p>

  <p>All coronets of degree actually, and are usually represented to,
  enclose a cap of crimson velvet, turned up with ermine. None of them are
  permitted to be jewelled, but the coronet of a duke, marquess, earl, or
  viscount is chased in the form of jewels. In recent times, however, it
  has become very usual for peers to use, heraldically, for more informal
  purposes a representation of the circlet only, omitting the cap and the
  ermine edging.</p>

  <p>The crown or coronet of a king of arms (Fig. 653) is of silver-gilt
  formed of a circlet, upon which is inscribed part of the first verse of
  the 51st Psalm, viz.: "Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam
  tuam." The rim is surmounted with sixteen leaves, in shape resembling the
  oak-leaf, every alternate one being somewhat higher than the rest, nine
  of which appear in the profile view of it or in heraldic representations.
  The cap is of crimson satin, closed at the top by a gold tassel and
  turned up with ermine.</p>

  <p>Anciently, the crown of Lyon King of Arms was, in shape, an exact

  that it was not jewelled.</p>

  <p>Coronets of rank are used very indiscriminately on the Continent,
  particularly in France and the Low Countries. Their use by no means
  implies the same as with us, and frequently indicates little if anything
  beyond mere "noble" birth.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mauerkrone</i> [mural crown] (Fig. 654) is used in Germany
  principally as an adornment to the arms of towns. It is borne with three,
  four, or five battlemented towers. The tincture, likewise, is not <!--
  Page 369 --><span class="pagenum" title="417.png"><a
  name="page369"></a>{369}</span>always the same: gold, silver, red, or the
  natural colour of a wall being variously employed. Residential
  [<i>i.e.</i> having a <i>royal</i> residence] and capital towns usually
  bear a Mauerkrone with five towers, large towns one with four towers,
  smaller towns one with three. Strict regulations in the matter do not yet
  exist. It should be carefully noted that this practice is peculiar to
  Germany and is quite incorrect in Great Britain.</p>

  <p>The <i>Naval Crown</i> [Schiffskrone] (Fig. 655), on the circlet of
  which sails and sterns of ships are alternately introduced, is very
  rarely used on the Continent. With us it appears as a charge in the arms
  of the towns of Chatham, Ramsgate, Devonport, &amp;c. The Naval Coronet,
  however, is more properly a crest coronet, and as such will be more fully
  considered in the next chapter. It had, however, a limited use as a
  coronet of rank at one time, inasmuch as the admirals of the United
  Provinces of the Netherlands placed a crown composed of prows of ships
  above their escutcheons, as may be seen from various monuments. <!-- Page

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXIII</h5>

<h5>CREST CORONETS AND CHAPEAUX</h5>

  <p>The present official rules are that crests must be upon, or must issue
  from, a wreath (or torse), a coronet, or a chapeau. It is not at the
  pleasure of the wearer to choose which he will, one or other being
  specified and included in the terms of the grant. If the crest have a
  lawful existence, one or other of them will unchangeably belong to the
  crest, of which it now is considered to be an integral part.</p>

  <p>In Scotland and Ireland, Lyon King of Arms and Ulster King of Arms
  have always been considered to have, and still retain, the right to grant
  crests upon a chapeau or issuing from a crest. But the power is (very
  properly) exceedingly sparingly used; and, except in the cases of arms
  and crests matriculated in Lyon Register as of ancient origin and in use
  before 1672, or "confirmed" on the strength of user by Ulster King of
  Arms, the ordinary ducal crest coronet and the chapeau are not now
  considered proper to be granted in ordinary cases.</p>

  <p>Since about the beginning of the nineteenth century the rules which
  follow have been very definite, and have been very rigidly adhered to in
  the English College of Arms.</p>

  <p>Crests issuing from the ordinary "ducal crest coronet" are not now
  granted under any circumstances. The chapeau is only granted in the case
  of a grant of arms to a peer, a mural coronet is only granted to officers
  in the army of the rank of general or above, and the naval coronet is
  only granted to officers in his Majesty's Royal Navy of the rank of
  admiral and above. An Eastern coronet is now only granted in the case of
  those of high position in one or other of the Imperial Services, who have
  served in India and the East.</p>

  <p>The granting of crests issuing from the other forms of crest coronets,
  the "crown-vallary" and the "crown palisado," is always discouraged, but
  no rule exists denying them to applicants, and they are to be obtained if
  the expectant grantee is sufficiently patient, importunate, and
  pertinacious. Neither form is, however, particularly ornamental, and both
  are of modern origin. <!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum" title="419.png"
  ><a name="page371"></a>{371}</span></p>

  <p>There is still yet another coronet, the "celestial coronet". This is
  not unusual as a charge, but as a coronet from which a crest issues I
  know of no instance, nor am I aware of what rules, if any, govern the
  granting of it.</p>

  <p>Definite rank coronets have been in times past granted for use as
  crest coronets, but this practice, the propriety of which cannot be
  considered as other than highly questionable, has only been pursued, even
  in the more lax days which are past, on rare and very exceptional
  occasions, and has long since been definitely abandoned as improper.</p>

  <p>In considering the question of crest coronets, the presumption that
  they originated from coronets of rank at once jumps to the mind. This is
  by no means a foregone conclusion. It is difficult to say what is the
  earliest instance of the use of a coronet in this country as a coronet of
  rank. When it is remembered that the coronet of a baron had no existence
  whatever until it was called into being by a warrant of Charles II. after
  the Restoration, and that differentiated coronets for the several ranks
  in the Peerage are not greatly anterior in date, the question becomes
  distinctly complicated. From certainly the reign of Edward the Confessor
  the kings of England had worn crowns, and the great territorial earls,
  who it must be remembered occupied a position akin to that of a petty
  sovereign (far beyond the mere high dignity of a great noble at the
  present day), from an early period wore crowns or coronets not greatly
  differing in appearance from the crown of the king. But the Peerage as
  such certainly neither had nor claimed the technical right to a coronet
  as a mark of their rank, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But
  coronets of a kind were used, as can be seen from early effigies, long
  before the use of crests became general. But these coronets were merely
  in the nature of a species of decoration for the helmet, many of them far
  more closely resembling a jewelled torse than a coronet. Parker in his
  "Glossary of Terms used in Heraldry" probably correctly represents the
  case when he states: "From the reign of Edward III. coronets of various
  forms were worn (as it seems indiscriminately) by princes, dukes, earls,
  and even knights, but apparently rather by way of ornament than
  distinction, or if for distinction, only (like the collar of SS) as a
  mark of gentility. The helmet of Edward the Black Prince, upon his effigy
  at Canterbury, is surrounded with a coronet totally different from that
  subsequently assigned to his rank."</p>

  <p>The instance quoted by Parker might be amplified by countless others,
  but it may here with advantage be pointed out that the great helmet (or,
  as this probably is, the ceremonial representation of it) suspended above
  the Prince's tomb (Fig. 271) has no coronet, and the crest is upon a
  chapeau. Of the fourteen instances in the <!-- Page 372 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="420.png"><a
  name="page372"></a>{372}</span>Plantagenet Garter plates in which the
  <i>torse</i> appears, twelve were peers of England, one was a foreign
  count, and one only a commoner. On the other hand, of twenty-nine whose
  Garter plates show crests issuing from coronets, four are foreigners,
  seven are commoners, and eighteen were peers. The coronets show very
  great variations in form and design, but such variations appear quite
  capricious, and to carry no meaning, nor does it seem probable that a
  coronet of gules or of azure, of which there are ten, could represent a
  coronet of rank. The Garter plate of Sir William De la Pole, Earl of
  (afterwards Duke of) Suffolk, shows his crest upon a narrow black fillet.
  Consequently, whatever may be the conclusion as to the wearing of
  coronets alone, it would seem to be a very certain conclusion that the
  heraldic crest coronet bore no relation to any coronet of rank or to the
  right to wear one. Its adoption must have been in the original instance,
  and probably even in subsequent generations, a matter of pure fancy and
  inclination. This is borne out by the fact that whilst the Garter plate
  of Sir Henry Bourchier, Earl of Essex, shows his crest upon a torse, his
  effigy represents it issuing from a coronet.</p>

  <p>Until the reign of Henry VIII., the Royal crest, both in the case of
  the sovereign and all the other members of the Royal Family, is always
  represented upon a chapeau or cap of dignity. The Great Seal of Edward
  VI. shows the crest upon a coronet, though the present form of crown and
  crest were originated by Queen Elizabeth. In depicting the Royal Arms, it
  is usual to omit one of the crowns, and this is always done in the
  official warrants controlling the arms. One crown is placed upon the
  helmet, and upon this crown is placed the crest, but theoretically the
  Royal achievement has two crowns, inasmuch as one of the crowns is an
  inseparable part of the crest. Probably the finest representation of the
  Royal crest which has ever been done is the design for one of the smaller
  bookplates for the Windsor Castle Library. This was executed by Mr. Eve,
  and it would be impossible to imagine anything finer. Like the rest of
  the Royal achievement, the Royal crest is of course not hereditary, and
  consequently it is assigned by a <i>separate</i> Royal Warrant to each
  male member of the Royal Family, and the opportunity is then taken to
  substitute for the Royal crown, which is a part of the sovereign's crest,
  a coronet identical with whatever may be assigned in that particular
  instance as the coronet of rank. In the case of Royal bastards the crest
  has always been assigned upon a chapeau.</p>

  <p>The only case which comes to one's mind in which the Royal crown has
  (outside the sovereign) been allowed as a crest coronet is the case of
  the town of Eye.</p>

  <p>The Royal crown of Scotland is the crest coronet of the sovereign's
  <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum" title="421.png"><a
  name="page373"></a>{373}</span>crest for the kingdom of Scotland. This
  crest, together with the crest of Ireland, is never assigned to any
  member of the Royal Family except the sovereign. The crest of Ireland
  (which is on a wreath or and azure) is by the way confirmatory evidence
  that the crowns in the crests of Scotland and England have a duplicate
  and separate existence apart from the crown denoting the sovereignty of
  the realm.</p>

  <p>The ordinary crest coronet or, as it is usually termed in British
  heraldry, the "ducal coronet" (Ulster, however, describes it officially
  as "a ducal crest coronet"), is quite a separate matter from a duke's
  coronet of rank. Whilst the coronet of a duke has upon the rim five
  strawberry leaves visible when depicted, a ducal coronet has only three.
  The "ducal coronet" (Fig. 656) is the conventional "regularised"
  development of the crest coronets employed in early times.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately it has in many instances been depicted of a much greater
  and very unnecessary width, the result being inartistic and allowing
  unnecessary space between the leaves, and at the same time leaving the
  crest and coronet with little circumferential relation. It should be
  noted that it is quite incorrect for the rim of the coronet to be
  jewelled in colour though the outline of jewelling is indicated.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig656.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig656.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    656.</span>&mdash;Ducal coronet.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Though ducal crest coronets are no longer granted (of course they are
  still exemplified and their use permitted where they have been previously
  granted), they are of very frequent occurrence in older grants and
  confirmations.</p>

  <p>It is quite incorrect to depict a cap (as in a coronet of rank) in a
  crest coronet, which is never more than the metal circlet, and
  consequently it is equally incorrect to add the band of ermine below it
  which will sometimes be seen.</p>

  <p>The coronet of a duke has in one or two isolated cases been granted as
  a crest coronet. In such a case it is not described as a duke's coronet,
  but as a "ducal coronet of five leaves." It so occurs in the case of
  Ormsby-Hamilton.</p>

  <p>The colour of the crest coronet must be stated in the blazon. Crest
  coronets are of all colours, and will be sometimes found bearing charges
  upon the rim (particularly in the cases of mural and naval coronets). An
  instance of this will be seen in the case of Sir John W. Moore, and of
  Mansergh, the label in this latter case being an unalterable charge and
  not the difference mark of an eldest son. Though the tincture of the
  coronet ought to appear in the blazon, nevertheless it is always a fair
  presumption (when it is not specified) that it is of gold, coronets of
  colours being very much less frequently met with. On this point it is
  interesting to note that in some of the cases where <!-- Page 374
  --><span class="pagenum" title="422.png"><a
  name="page374"></a>{374}</span>the crest coronet is figured upon an early
  Garter plate as of colour, it is now borne gold by the present
  descendants of the family. For example on the Garter plate of Sir Walter
  Hungerford, Lord Hungerford, the crest ["A garb or, between two silver
  sickles"] issues from a coronet azure. The various Hungerford families
  now bear it "or." The crest upon the Garter plate of Sir Humphrey
  Stafford, Duke of Buckingham ["A demi-swan argent, beaked gules"], issues
  from a coronet gules. This crest as it is now borne by the present Lord
  Stafford is: "Out of a ducal coronet per pale gules and sable,"
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Another instance of coloured coronets will be found in the crest of
  Nicholson, now borne by Shaw.<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Probably, however, the most curious instance of all will be found in
  the case of a crest coronet of ermine, of which an example occurs in the
  Gelre "Armorial."</p>

  <p>A very general misconception&mdash;which will be found stated in
  practically every text-book of armory&mdash;is that when a crest issues
  from a coronet the wreath must be omitted. There is not and never has
  been any such rule. The rule is rather to the contrary. Instances where
  both occur are certainly now uncommon, and the presence of a wreath is
  not in present-day practice considered to be essential if a coronet
  occurs, but the use or absence of a wreath when the crest issues from a
  coronet really depends entirely upon the original grant. If no wreath is
  specified with the coronet, none will be used or needed, but if both are
  granted both should be used. An instance of the use of both will be found
  on the Garter Stall plate of Sir Walter Devereux, Lord Ferrers. The crest
  (a talbot's head silver) issues from a coronet or, which is placed upon a
  torse argent and sable. Another instance will be found in the case of the
  grant of the crest of Hanbury.</p>

  <p>A quite recent case was the grant by Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster King of
  Arms, of a crest to Sir Richard Quain, Bart., the blazon of which was:
  "On a wreath argent and azure, and out of a mural coronet proper a
  demi-lion rampant or, charged on the shoulder with a trefoil slipped
  vert, and holding between the paws a battle-axe also proper, the blade
  gold."</p>

  <p>Other instances are the crests of Hamilton of Sunningdale and
  Tarleton.</p>

  <p>Another instance will be found in the grant to Ross-of-Bladensburg.
  Possibly this blazon may be a clerical error in the engrossment, because
  it will be noticed that the wreath does not appear in the emblazonment
  (Plate II.).</p>

  <p>I wonder how many of the officers of arms are aware of the <!-- Page
  375 --><span class="pagenum" title="423.png"><a
  name="page375"></a>{375}</span>existence of a warrant, dated in 1682,
  issued by the Deputy Earl-Marshal to the Companies of Painters, Stainers,
  and Coachmakers, forbidding them to paint crests which issue out of ducal
  coronets without putting them upon "wreaths of their colours." The
  wording of the warrant very plainly shows that at that date a wreath was
  always painted below a crest coronet. The warrant, however, is not so
  worded that it can be accepted as determining the point for the future,
  or that it would override a subsequent grant of a crest in contrary form.
  But it is evidence of what the law then was.</p>

  <p>No crest is now granted without either wreath, coronet, or
  chapeau.</p>

  <p>An instance of the use of the coronet of a marquess as a crest coronet
  will be found in the case of the Bentinck crest.<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There are some number of instances of the use of an earl's coronet as
  a crest coronet. Amongst these may be mentioned the crests of Sir Alan
  Seton Steuart, Bart. ["Out of an earl's coronet a dexter hand grasping a
  thistle all proper"], that granted to Cassan of Sheffield House, Ireland
  ["Issuant from an earl's coronet proper, a boar's head and neck erased or
  langued gules"], James Christopher Fitzgerald Kenney, Esq., Dublin ["Out
  of an earl's coronet or, the pearls argent, a cubit arm erect vested
  gules, cuffed also argent, the hand grasping a roll of parchment
  proper"], and Davidson ["Out of an earl's coronet or, a dove rising
  argent, holding in the beak a wheat-stalk bladed and eared all
  proper"].</p>

  <p>I know of no crest which issues from the coronet of a viscount, but a
  baron's coronet occurs in the case of Forbes of Pitsligo and the cadets
  of that branch of the family: "Issuing out of a baron's coronet a dexter
  hand holding a scimitar all proper."</p>

  <p>Foreign coronets of rank have sometimes been granted as crest coronets
  in this country, as in the cases of the crests of Sir Francis George
  Manningham Boileau, Bart., Norfolk ["In a nest or, a pelican in her piety
  proper, charged on the breast with a saltire couped gules, the nest
  resting in a foreign coronet"], Henry Chamier, Esq., Dublin ["Out of a
  French noble coronet proper, a cubit arm in bend vested azure, charged
  with five fleurs-de-lis in saltire or, cuffed ermine, holding in the hand
  a scroll, and thereon an open book proper, garnished gold"], John Francis
  Charles Fane De Salis, Count of the Holy Roman Empire ["1. Out of a
  marquis' coronet or, a demi-woman proper, crowned or, hair flowing down
  the back, winged in place of arms and from the armpits azure; 2. out of a
  ducal coronet or, an eagle displayed sable, ducally crowned also or; 3.
  out of a ducal coronet a demi-lion rampant double-queued and crowned with
  a like <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum" title="424.png"><a
  name="page376"></a>{376}</span>coronet all or, brandishing a sword
  proper, hilt and pommel of the first, the lion cottised by two
  tilting-spears of the same, from each a banner paly of six argent and
  gules, fringed also or"], and Mahony, Ireland ["Out of the coronet of a
  Count of France a dexter arm in armour embowed grasping in the hand a
  sword all proper, hilt and pommel or, the blade piercing a fleur-de-lis
  of the last"].</p>

  <p>A curious crest coronet will be found with the Sackville crest. This
  is composed of fleurs-de-lis only, the blazon of the crest being: "Out of
  a coronet composed of eight fleurs-de-lis or, an estoile of eight points
  argent."</p>

  <p>A curious use of coronets in a crest will be found in the crest of Sir
  Archibald Dunbar, Bart. ["A dexter hand apaumée reaching at an astral
  crown proper"] and Sir Alexander James Dunbar, Bart. ["A dexter hand
  apaumée proper reaching to two earls' coronets tied together"].</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:12%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    657.</span>&mdash;Mural coronet.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Next after the ordinary "ducal coronet" the one most usually employed
  is the mural coronet (Fig. 657), which is composed of masonry. Though it
  may be and often is of an ordinary heraldic tincture, it will usually be
  found "proper." An exception occurs in the case of the crest of
  Every-Halstead ["Out of a mural coronet chequy or and azure, a demi-eagle
  ermine beaked or."]</p>

  <p>Care should be taken to distinguish the mural crown from the
  "battlements of a tower." This originated as a modern "fakement" and is
  often granted to those who have been using a mural coronet, and desire to
  continue within its halo, but are not qualified to obtain in their own
  persons a grant of it. It should be noticed that the battlements of a
  tower must always be represented upon a wreath. Its facility for adding a
  noticeable distinction to a crest has, however, in these days, when it is
  becoming somewhat difficult to introduce differences in a stock pattern
  kind of crest, led to its very frequent use in grants during the last
  hundred years.</p>

  <p>Care should also be taken to distinguish between the "battlements of a
  tower" and a crest issuing from "a castle," as in the case of Harley; "a
  tower," as in that of Boyce; and upon the "capital of a column," as in
  the crests of Cowper-Essex and Pease.</p>

  <p>Abroad, <i>e.g.</i> in the arms of Paris, it is very usual to place a
  mural crown over the shield of a town, and some remarks upon the point
  will be found on page <a href="#page368">368</a>. This at first sight may
  seem an appropriate practice to pursue, and several heraldic artists have
  followed it and advocate it in this country. But the correctness of such
  a practice is, for British purposes, strongly and emphatically denied
  officially, and whilst we reserve this privilege for grants to certain
  army officers of high <!-- Page 377 --><span class="pagenum" title="425.png"
  ><a name="page377"></a>{377}</span>rank, it does not seem proper that it
  should be available for casual and haphazard assumption by a town or
  city. That being the case, it should be borne in mind that the practice
  is not permissible in British armory.</p>

  <p>The naval coronet (Fig. 658), though but seldom granted now, was very
  popular at one time. In the latter part of the eighteenth and the early
  part of the nineteenth centuries, naval actions were constantly being
  fought, and in a large number of cases where the action of the officer in
  command was worthy of high praise and reward, part of such reward was
  usually an augmentation of arms. Very frequently it is found that the
  crest of augmentation issued from a naval coronet. This is, as will be
  seen, a curious figure composed of the sail and stern of a ship repeated
  and alternating on the rim of a circlet. Sometimes it is entirely gold,
  but usually the sails are argent. An instance of such a grant of
  augmentation will be found in the crest of augmentation for Brisbane and
  in a crest of augmentation granted to Sir Philip Bowes Broke to
  commemorate his glorious victory in the Shannon over the American ship
  <i>Chesapeake</i>.</p>

  <p>Any future naval grant of a crest of augmentation would probably mean,
  that it would be granted issuing out of a naval coronet, but otherwise
  the privilege is now confined to those grants of arms in which the
  patentee is of the rank of admiral. Instances of its use will be found in
  the crests of Schomberg and Farquhar, and in the crest of Dakyns of
  Derbyshire: "Out of a naval coronet or, a dexter arm embowed proper,
  holding in the hand a battle-axe argent, round the wrist a ribbon azure."
  The crest of Dakyns is chiefly memorable for the curious motto which
  accompanies it; "Strike, Dakyns, the devil's in the hempe," of which no
  one knows the explanation.</p>

  <p>Why a naval crown was recently granted as a badge to a family named
  Vickers (Plate VIII.) I am still wondering.</p>

  <p>The crest of Lord St. Vincent ["Out of a naval coronet or, encircled
  by a wreath of oak proper, a demi-pegasus argent, maned and hoofed of the
  first, winged azure, charged on the wing with a fleur-de-lis gold"] is
  worthy of notice owing to the encircling of the coronet, and in some
  number of cases the circlet of the coronet has been made use of to carry
  the name of a captured ship or of a naval engagement.</p>

  <p>The Eastern Coronet (Fig. 659) is a plain rim heightened with spikes.
  Formerly it was granted without restriction, but now, as has <!-- Page
  378 --><span class="pagenum" title="426.png"><a
  name="page378"></a>{378}</span>been already stated, it is reserved for
  those of high rank who have served in India or the East. An instance
  occurs, for example, in the crest of Rawlinson, Bart. ["Sable, three
  swords in pale proper, pommels and hilts or, two erect, points upwards,
  between them one, point downwards, on a chief embattled of the third an
  antique crown gules. Crest: out of an Eastern crown or, a cubit arm erect
  in armour, the hand grasping a sword in bend sinister, and the wrist
  encircled by a laurel wreath proper"].</p>

  <p>Of <i>identically</i> the same shape is what is known as the "Antique
  Coronet." It has no particular meaning, and though no objection is made
  to granting it in Scotland and Ireland, it is not granted in England.
  Instances in which it occurs under such a description will be found in
  the cases of Lanigan O'Keefe and Matheson.</p>

  <p>The Crown Vallary or Vallary Coronet (Fig. 660) and the Palisado
  Coronet (Fig. 661) were undoubtedly originally the same, but now the two
  forms in which it has been depicted are considered to be different
  coronets. Each has the rim, but the vallary coronet is now heightened
  only by pieces of the shape of vair, whilst the palisado coronet is
  formed by high "palisadoes" affixed to the rim. These two are the only
  forms of coronet granted to ordinary and undistinguished applicants in
  England.</p>

  <p>The circlet from the crown of a king of arms has once at least been
  granted as a crest coronet, this being in the case of Rogers
  Harrison.</p>

  <p>In a recent grant of arms to Gee, the crest has no wreath, but issues
  from "a circlet or, charged with a fleur-de-lis gules." The circlet is
  emblazoned as a plain gold band.</p>

<h5>THE CHAPEAU</h5>

  <p>Some number of crests will be found to have been granted to be borne
  upon a "chapeau" in lieu of wreath or coronet. Other names for the
  chapeau, under which it is equally well known, are the "cap of
  maintenance" or "cap of dignity."</p>

  <p>There can be very little doubt that the heraldic chapeau combines two
  distinct origins or earlier prototypes. The one is the real cap of
  dignity, and the other is the hat or "capelot" which covered the top of
  the helm before the mantling was introduced, but from which the <!-- Page
  379 --><span class="pagenum" title="427.png"><a
  name="page379"></a>{379}</span>lambrequin developed. The curious
  evolution of the chapeau from the "capelot," which is so marked and usual
  in Germany, is the tall conical hat, often surmounted by a tuft or larger
  plume of feathers, and usually employed in German heraldry as an
  opportunity for the repetition of the livery colours, or a part of, and
  often the whole design of, the arms. But it should at the same time be
  noticed that this tall, conical hat is much more closely allied to the
  real cap of maintenance than our present crest "chapeau."</p>

  <p>Exactly what purpose the real cap of maintenance served, or of what it
  was a symbol, remains to a certain extent a matter of mystery. The "Cap
  of Maintenance"&mdash;a part of the regalia borne before the sovereign at
  the State opening of Parliament (but <i>not</i> at a coronation) by the
  Marquesses of Winchester, the hereditary bearers of the cap of
  maintenance&mdash;bears, in its shape, no relation to the heraldic
  chapeau. The only similarity is its crimson colour and its lining of
  ermine. It is a tall, conical cap and is carried on a short staff.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    662.</span>&mdash;The Crown of King Charles II.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Whilst crest coronets in early days appear to have had little or no
  relation to titular rank, there is no doubt whatever that caps of dignity
  had. Long before, a coronet was assigned to the rank of baron in the
  reign of Charles II.; all barons had their caps of dignity, of scarlet
  lined with white fur; and in the old pedigrees a scarlet cap with a gold
  tuft or tassel on top and a lining of fur will be found painted above the
  arms of a baron. This fact, the fact that until after Stuart days the
  chapeau does not appear to have been allowed or granted to others than
  peers, the fact that it is now reserved for the crests granted to peers,
  the fact that the velvet cap is a later addition both to the sovereign's
  crown and to the coronet of a peer, and finally the fact that the cap of
  maintenance is borne before the sovereign only in the precincts of
  Parliament, would seem to indubitably indicate that the cap of
  maintenance was inseparably connected with the lordship and overlordship
  of Parliament vested in peers and in the sovereign. In the crumpled and
  tasselled top of the velvet cap, and in the ermine border visible below
  the rim, the high conical form of the cap of maintenance proper can be
  still traced in the cap of a peer's coronet, and that the velvet cap
  contained in <!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum" title="428.png"><a
  name="page380"></a>{380}</span>the crown of the sovereign and in the
  coronet of a peer is the survival of the old cap of dignity there can be
  no doubt. This is perhaps even more apparent in Fig. 662, which shows the
  crown of King Charles II., than in the representations of the Royal crown
  which we are more accustomed to see. The present form of a peer's coronet
  is undoubtedly the conjoining of two separate emblems of his rank. The
  cap of maintenance or dignity, however, as represented above the arms of
  a baron, as above referred to, was not of this high, conical shape. It
  was much flatter.</p>

  <p>The high, conical, original shape is, however, preserved in many of
  the early heraldic representations of the chapeau, as will be noticed
  from an examination of the ancient Garter plates or from a reference to
  Fig. 271, which shows the helmet with its chapeau-borne crest of Edward
  the Black Prince.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    663.</span>&mdash;The Chapeau.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Of the chapeaux upon which crests are represented in the early Garter
  plates the following facts may be observed. They are twenty in number of
  the eighty-six plates reproduced in Mr. St. John Hope's book. It should
  be noticed that until the end of the reign of Henry VIII. the Royal crest
  of the sovereign was always depicted upon a chapeau gules, lined with
  ermine. Of the twenty instances in which the chapeau appears, no less
  than twelve are representations of the Royal crest, borne by closely
  allied relatives of the sovereign, so that we have only eight examples
  from which to draw deductions. But of the twenty it should be pointed out
  that nineteen are peers, and the only remaining instance (Sir John Grey,
  K.G.) is that of the eldest son and heir apparent of a peer, both shield
  and crest being in this case boldly marked with the "label" of an eldest
  son. Consequently it is a safe deduction that whatever may have been the
  regulations and customs concerning the use of coronets, there can be no
  doubt that down to the end of the fifteenth century the use of a chapeau
  marked a crest as that of a peer. Of the eight non-Royal examples one has
  been repainted, and is valueless as a contemporary record. Of the
  remaining seven, four are of the conventional gules and ermine. One only
  has not the ermine lining, that being the crest of Lord Fanhope. It is
  plainly the Royal crest "differenced" (he being of Royal but illegitimate
  descent), and probably the argent in lieu of ermine lining is one of the
  intentional marks of distinction. The chapeau of Lord Beaumont is azure,
  semé-de-lis, lined ermine, and that of the Earl of Douglas is azure lined
  ermine, this being in each case in conformity with the mantling. Whilst
  the Beaumont family still use this curiously coloured chapeau with their
  crest, the Douglas crest is now borne (by <!-- Page 381 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="429.png"><a name="page381"></a>{381}</span>the
  Duke of Hamilton) upon one of ordinary tinctures. Chapeaux, other than of
  gules lined ermine, are but rarely met with, and unless specifically
  blazoned to the contrary a cap of maintenance is always presumed to be
  gules and ermine.</p>

  <p>About the Stuart period the granting of crests upon chapeaux to others
  than peers became far from unusual, and the practice appears to have been
  frequently adopted prior to the beginning of the nineteenth century. Some
  of these crest chapeaux, however, were not of gules. An instance of this
  kind will be found in the grant in 1667 to Sir Thomas Davies, then one of
  the sheriffs of the City of London, but afterwards (in 1677) Lord Mayor.
  The crest granted was: "On a chapeau sable, turned up or, a demi-lion
  rampant of the last." The reason for the grant at that date of such a
  simple crest and the even more astonishingly simple coat of arms ["Or, a
  chevron between three mullets pierced sable"] has always been a mystery
  to me.</p>

  <p>The arms of Lord Lurgan (granted or confirmed 1840) afford another
  instance of a chapeau of unusual colour, his crest being: "Upon a chapeau
  azure turned up ermine, a greyhound statant gules, collared or."</p>

  <p>There are some number of cases in which peers whose ancestors
  originally bore their crests upon a wreath have subsequently placed them
  upon a chapeau. The Stanleys, Earls of Derby, are a case in point, as are
  also the Marquesses of Exeter. The latter case is curious, because
  although they have for long enough so depicted their crest, they only
  comparatively recently (within the last few years) obtained the necessary
  authorisation by the Crown.</p>

  <p>At the present time the official form of the chapeau is as in Fig.
  663, with the turn up split at the back into two tails. No such form can
  be found in any early representation, and most heraldic artists have now
  reverted to an earlier type.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the subject of the cap of maintenance, reference should
  be made to another instance of a curious heraldic headgear often, but
  <i>quite incorrectly</i>, styled a "cap of maintenance." This is the fur
  cap invariably used over the shields of the cities of London, Dublin, and
  Norwich. There is no English official authority whatever for such an
  addition to the arms, but there does appear to be some little official
  recognition of it in Ulster's Office in the case of the city of Dublin.
  The late Ulster King of Arms, however, informed me that he would, in the
  case of Dublin, have no hesitation whatever in certifying the right of
  the city arms to be so displayed (Plate VII.).</p>

  <p>In the utter absence of anything in the nature of a precedent, it is
  quite unlikely that the practice will be sanctioned in England. The <!--
  Page 382 --><span class="pagenum" title="430.png"><a
  name="page382"></a>{382}</span>hat used is a flat-topped, brown fur hat
  of the shape depicted with the arms of the City of Dublin. It is merely
  (in London) a part of the official uniform or livery of the City
  sword-bearer. It does not even appear to have been a part of the costume
  of the Lord Mayor, and it must always remain a mystery why it was ever
  adopted for heraldic use. But then the chain of the Lord Mayor of London
  is generally called a Collar of SS. Besides this the City of London uses
  a Peer's helmet, a bogus modern crest, and even more modern bogus
  supporters, so a few other eccentricities need not in that particular
  instance cause surprise. <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum" title="431.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXIV</h5>

<h5>THE MANTLING OR LAMBREQUIN</h5>

  <p>The mantling is the ornamental design which in a representation of an
  armorial achievement depends from the helmet, falling away on either side
  of the escutcheon. Many authorities have considered it to have been no
  more than a fantastic series of flourishes, devised by artistic minds for
  the purpose of assisting ornamentation and affording an artistic
  opportunity of filling up unoccupied spaces in a heraldic design. There
  is no doubt that its readily apparent advantages in that character have
  greatly led to the importance now attached to the mantling in heraldic
  art. But equally is it certain that its real origin is to be traced
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The development of the heraldry of to-day was in the East during the
  period of the Crusades, and the burning heat of the Eastern sun upon the
  metal helmet led to the introduction and adoption of a textile covering,
  which would act in some way as a barrier between the two. It was simply
  in fact and effect a primeval prototype of the "puggaree" of Margate and
  Hindustan. It is plain from all early representations that originally it
  was short, simply hanging from the apex of the helmet to the level of the
  shoulders, overlapping the textile tunic or "coat of arms," but probably
  enveloping a greater part of the helmet, neck, and shoulders than we are
  at present (judging from pictorial representations) inclined to
  believe.</p>

  <p>Adopted first as a protection against the heat, and perhaps also the
  rust which would follow damp, the lambrequin soon made evident another of
  its advantages, an advantage to which we doubtless owe its perpetuation
  outside Eastern warfare in the more temperate climates of Northern Europe
  and England. Textile fabrics are peculiarly and remarkably deadening to a
  sword-cut, to which fact must be added the facility with which such a
  weapon would become entangled in the hanging folds of cloth. The hacking
  and hewing of battle would show itself plainly upon the lambrequin of one
  accustomed to a prominent position in the forefront of a fight, and the
  honourable record implied by a ragged and slashed lambrequin accounts for
  the fact that we find at an early period after their introduction into
  heraldic art, that mantlings <!-- Page 384 --><span class="pagenum" title="432.png"
  ><a name="page384"></a>{384}</span>are depicted cut and "torn to
  ribbons." This opportunity was quickly seized by the heraldic artist, who
  has always, from those very earliest times of absolute armorial freedom
  down to the point of greatest and most regularised control, been allowed
  an entire and absolute discretion in the design to be adopted for the
  mantling. Hence it is that we find so much importance is given to it by
  heraldic artists, for it is in the design of the mantling, and almost
  entirely in that opportunity, that the personal character and abilities
  of the artist have their greatest scope. Some authorities have, however,
  derived the mantling from the robe of estate, and there certainly has
  been a period in British armory when most lambrequins found in heraldic
  art are represented by an unmutilated cloth, suspended from and displayed
  behind the armorial bearings and tied at the upper corners. In all
  probability the robes of estate of the higher nobility, no less than the
  then existing and peremptorily enforced sumptuary laws, may have led to
  the desire and to the attempt, at a period when the actual lambrequin was
  fast disappearing from general knowledge, to display arms upon something
  which should represent either the parliamentary robes of estate of a
  peer, or the garments of rich fabric which the sumptuary laws forbade to
  those of humble degree. To this period undoubtedly belongs the term
  "mantling," which is so much more frequently employed than the word
  lambrequin, which is really&mdash;from the armorial point of
  view&mdash;the older term.</p>

  <p>The heraldic mantling was, of course, originally the representation of
  the actual "capeline" or textile covering worn upon the helmet, but many
  early heraldic representations are of mantlings which are of skin, fur,
  or feathers, being in such cases invariably a continuation of the crest
  drawn out and represented as the lambrequin. When the crest was a part of
  the human figure, the habit in which that figure was arrayed is almost
  invariably found to have been so employed. The Garter plate of Sir Ralph
  Bassett, one of the Founder Knights, shows the crest as a black boar's
  head, the skin being continued as the sable mantling.</p>

  <p>Some Sclavonic families have mantlings of fur only, that of the
  Hungarian family of Chorinski is a bear skin, and countless other
  instances can be found of the use by German families of a continuation of
  the crest for a mantling. This practice affords instances of many curious
  mantlings, this in one case in the Zurich <i>Wappenrolle</i> being the
  scaly skin of a salmon. The mane of the lion, the crest of Mertz, and the
  hair and beard of the crests of Bohn and Landschaden, are similarly
  continued to do duty for the mantling. This practice has never found
  great favour in England, the cases amongst the early Garter plates where
  it has been followed standing almost alone. In a <!-- Page 385 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="435.png"><a
  name="page385"></a>{385}</span>manuscript (M. 3, 67<i>b</i>) of the reign
  of Henry VII., now in the College of Arms, probably dating from about
  1506, an instance of this character can be found, however. It is a
  representation of the crest of Stourton (Fig. 664) as it was borne at
  that date, and was a black Benedictine demi-monk proper holding erect in
  his dexter hand a scourge. Here the proper black Benedictine habit (it
  has of later years been corrupted into the russet habit of a friar) is
  continued to form the mantling.</p>

  </div>

  <p>By what rules the colours of the mantlings were decided in early times
  it is impossible to say. No rules have been handed down to us&mdash;the
  old heraldic books are silent on the point&mdash;and it seems equally
  hopeless to attempt to deduce any from ancient armorial examples. The one
  fact that can be stated with certainty is that the rules of early days,
  if there were any, are not the rules presently observed. Some hold that
  the colours of the mantling were decided by the colours of the actual
  livery in use as distinct from the "livery colours" of the arms. It is
  difficult to check this rule, because our knowledge of the liveries in
  use in early days is so meagre and limited; but in the few instances of
  which we now have knowledge we look in vain for a repetition of the
  colours worn by the retainers as liveries in the mantlings used. The fact
  that the livery colours are represented in the background of some of the
  early Garter plates, and that in such instances in no single case do they
  agree with the colours of the mantling, must certainly dissipate once and
  for all any such supposition as far as it relates to that period.</p>

  <p>A careful study and analysis of early heraldic emblazonment, however,
  reveals one point as a dominating characteristic. That is, that where the
  crest, by its nature, lent itself to a continuation into the mantling it
  generally was so continued. This practice, which was almost universal
  upon the Continent, and is particularly to be met with <!-- Page 386
  --><span class="pagenum" title="436.png"><a
  name="page386"></a>{386}</span>in German heraldry, though seldom adopted
  in England, certainly had some weight in English heraldry. In the
  recently published reproductions of the Plantagenet Garter plates
  eighty-seven armorial achievements are included. Of these, in ten
  instances the mantlings are plainly continuations of the crests, being
  "feathered" or in unison. Fifteen of the mantlings have both the outside
  and the inside of the principal colour and of the principal metal of the
  arms they accompany, though in a few cases, contrary to the present
  practice, the metal is outside, the lining being of the colour. Nineteen
  more of the mantlings are of the principal colour of the arms, the
  majority (eighteen) of these being lined with ermine. No less than
  forty-nine are of some colour lined with ermine, but thirty-four of these
  are of gules lined ermine, and in the large majority of cases in these
  thirty-four instances neither the gules nor the ermine are in conformity
  with the principal colour and metal (what we now term the "livery
  colours") of the arms. In some cases the colours of the mantling agree
  with the colours of the crest, a rule which will usually be found to hold
  good in German heraldry. The constant occurrence of gules and ermine
  incline one much to believe that the colours of the mantling were not
  decided by haphazard fancy, but that there was some law&mdash;possibly in
  some way connected with the sumptuary laws of the period&mdash;which
  governed the matter, or, at any rate, which greatly limited the range of
  selection. Of the eighty-seven mantlings, excluding those which are gules
  lined ermine, there are four only the colours of which apparently bear no
  relation whatever to the colours of the arms or the crests appearing upon
  the same Stall plate. In some number of the plates the colours certainly
  are taken from a quartering other than the first one, and in one at least
  of the four exceptions the mantling (one of the most curious examples) is
  plainly derived from a quartering inherited by the knight in question
  though not shown upon the Stall plate. Probably a closer examination of
  the remaining three instances would reveal a similar reason in each case.
  That any law concerning the colours of their mantlings was enforced upon
  those concerned would be an unwarrantable deduction not justified by the
  instances under examination, but one is clearly justified in drawing from
  these cases some deductions as to the practice pursued. It is evident
  that unless one was authorised by the rule or reason governing the
  matter&mdash;whatever such rule or reason may have been&mdash;in using a
  mantling of gules and ermine, the dominating colour (not as a rule the
  metal) of the coat of arms (or of one of the quarterings), or sometimes
  of the crest if the tinctures of arms and crest were not in unison,
  decided the colour of the mantling. That there was some meaning behind
  the mantlings of gules lined with ermine there can be little doubt, for
  it is noticeable that in a case in <!-- Page 387 --><span class="pagenum" title="437.png"
  ><a name="page387"></a>{387}</span>which the colours of the arms
  themselves are gules and ermine, the mantling is of gules and argent, as
  by the way in this particular case is the chapeau upon which the crest is
  placed. But probably the reason which governed these mantlings of gules
  lined with ermine, as also the ermine linings of other mantlings, must be
  sought outside the strict limits of armory. That the colours of mantlings
  are repeated in different generations, and in the plates of members of
  the same family, clearly demonstrates that selection was not
  haphazard.</p>

  <p>Certain of these early Garter plates exhibit interesting curiosities
  in the mantlings:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Sir William Latimer, Lord Latimer, K.G., c. 1361-1381. Arms: gules
  a cross patonce or. Crest: a plume of feathers sable, the tips or.
  Mantling gules with silver vertical stripes, lined with ermine.</p>

  <p>2. Sir Bermond Arnaud de Presac, Soudan de la Tran, K.G.,
  1380-<i>post</i> 1384. Arms: or, a lion rampant double-queued gules.
  Crest: a Midas' head argent. Mantling sable, lined gules, the latter
  veined or.</p>

  <p>3. Sir Simon Felbrigge, K.G., 1397-1442. Arms: or, a lion rampant
  gules. Crest: out of a coronet gules, a plume of feathers ermine.
  Mantling ermine, lined gules (evidently a continuation of the crest).</p>

  <p>4. Sir Reginald Cobham, Lord Cobham, K.G., 1352-1361. Arms: gules, on
  a chevron or, three estoiles sable. Crest: a soldan's head sable, the
  brow encircled by a torse or. Mantling sable (evidently a continuation of
  the crest), lined gules.</p>

  <p>5. Sir Edward Cherleton, Lord Cherleton of Powis, K.G., 1406-7 to
  1420-1. Arms: or, a lion rampant gules. Crest: on a wreath gules and
  sable, two lions' gambs also gules, each adorned on the exterior side
  with three demi-fleurs-de-lis issuing argent, the centres thereof or.
  Mantling: on the dexter side, sable; on the sinister side, gules; both
  lined ermine.</p>

  <p>6. Sir Hertong von Clux, K.G., 1421-1445 or 6. Arms: argent, a vine
  branch couped at either end in bend sable. Crest: out of a coronet or, a
  plume of feathers sable and argent. Mantling: on the dexter side, azure;
  on the sinister, gules; both lined ermine.</p>

  <p>7. Sir Miles Stapleton, K.G. (Founder Knight, died 1364). Arms:
  argent, a lion rampant sable. Crest: a soldan's head sable, around the
  temples a torse azure, tied in a knot, the ends flowing. Mantling sable
  (probably a continuation of the crest), lined gules.</p>

  <p>8. Sir Walter Hungerford, Lord Hungerford and Heytesbury, K.G.,
  1421-1449. Arms: sable, two bars argent, and in chief three plates.
  Crest: out of a coronet azure a garb or, enclosed by two sickles argent.
  Mantling (within and without): dexter, barry of six <!-- Page 388
  --><span class="pagenum" title="438.png"><a
  name="page388"></a>{388}</span>ermine and gules; sinister, barry of six
  gules and ermine. (The reason of this is plain. The mother of Lord
  Hungerford was a daughter and coheir of Hussey. The arms of Hussey are
  variously given: "Barry of six ermine and gules," or "Ermine, three bars
  gules.")</p>

  <p>9. Sir Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Stafford, 1429-1460. Arms: or, a
  chevron gules. Crest: out of a coronet gules, a swan's head and neck
  proper, beaked gules, between two wings also proper. Mantling: the dexter
  side, sable; the sinister side, gules; both lined ermine. Black and

  <p>Whilst one can call to mind no instance of importance of ancient date
  where this practice has been followed in this country, there are one or
  two instances in the Garter plates which approximate closely to it. The
  mantling of John, Lord Beaumont, is azure, semé-de-lis (as the field of
  his arms), lined ermine. Those of Sir John Bourchier, Lord Berners, and
  of Sir Henry Bourchier, Earl of Essex, are of gules, billetté or,
  evidently derived from the quartering for Louvaine upon the arms, this
  quartering being: "Gules, billetté and a fess or."</p>

  <p>According to a MS. of Vincent, in the College of Arms, the Warrens
  used a mantling chequy of azure and or with their arms.</p>

  <p>A somewhat similar result is obtained by the mantling, "Gules, semé of
  lozenges or," upon the small plate of Sir Sanchet Dabrichecourt. The
  mantling of Sir Lewis Robessart, Lord Bourchier, is: "Azure, bezanté,
  lined argent."</p>

  <p>"The azure mantling on the Garter Plate of Henry V., as Prince of
  Wales, is 'semé of the French golden fleurs-de-lis.'... The Daubeny
  mantling is 'semé of mullets.' On the brass of Sir John Wylcote, at Tew,
  the lambrequins are chequy.... On the seals of Sir John Bussy, in 1391
  and 1407, the mantlings are barry, the coat being 'argent, three bars
  sable.'"</p>

  <p>There are a few cases amongst the Garter plates in which badges are
  plainly and unmistakably depicted upon the mantlings. Thus, on the lining
  of the mantling on the plate of Sir Henry Bourchier (elected 1452) will
  be found water-bougets, which are repeated on a fillet round the head of
  the crest. The Stall plate of Sir John Bourchier, Lord <!-- Page 390
  --><span class="pagenum" title="440.png"><a
  name="page390"></a>{390}</span>Berners, above referred to (elected 1459),
  is lined with silver on the dexter side, semé in the upper part with
  water-bougets, and in the lower part with Bourchier knots. On the
  opposite side of the mantling the knots are in the upper part, and the
  water-bougets below. That these badges upon the mantling are not
  haphazard artistic decoration is proved by a reference to the monumental
  effigy of the Earl of Essex, in Little Easton Church, Essex. The
  differing shapes of the helmet, and of the coronet and the mantling, and
  the different representation of the crest, show that, although depicted
  in his Garter robes, upon his effigy the helmet, crest, and mantling upon
  which the earl's head there rests, and the representations of the same
  upon the Garter plate, are not slavish copies of the same original model.
  Nevertheless upon the effigy, as on the Garter plate, we find the outside
  of the mantling "semé of billets," and the inside "semé of
  water-bougets." Another instance amongst the Garter plates will be found
  in the case of Viscount Lovell, whose mantling is strewn with gold
  padlocks.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the mantlings on the Garter Stall plates are more or less
  heavily "veined" with gold, and many are heavily diapered and decorated
  with floral devices. So prominent is some of this floral diapering that
  one is inclined to think that in a few cases it may possibly be a
  diapering with floral badges. In other cases it is equally evidently no
  more than a mere accessory of design, though between these two classes of
  diapering it would be by no means easy to draw a line of distinction. The
  veining and "heightening" of a mantling with gold is at the present day
  nearly always to be seen in elaborate heraldic painting.</p>

  <p>From the Garter plates of the fourteenth century it has been shown
  that the colours of a large proportion of the mantlings approximated in
  early days to the colours of the arms. The popularity of gules, however,
  was then fast encroaching upon the frequency of appearance which other
  colours should have enjoyed; and in the sixteenth century, in grants and
  other paintings of arms, the use of a mantling of gules had become
  practically universal. In most cases the mantling of "gules, doubled
  argent" forms an integral part of the terms of the grant itself, as
  sometimes do the "gold tassels" which are so frequently found terminating
  the mantlings of that and an earlier period. This custom continued
  through the Stuart period, and though dropped officially in England
  during the eighteenth century (when the mantling reverted to the livery
  colours of the arms, and became in this form a matter of course and so
  understood, not being expressed in the wording of the patent), it
  continued in force in Lyon Office in Scotland until the year 1890, when
  the present Lyon King of Arms (Sir James Balfour Paul) altered the
  practice, and, as had earlier been done in England, <!-- Page 391
  --><span class="pagenum" title="441.png"><a
  name="page391"></a>{391}</span>ordered that all future Scottish mantlings
  should be depicted in the livery colours of the arms, but in Scotland the
  mantlings, though now following the livery colours, are still included in
  the terms of the grant, and thereby stereotyped. In England, in an
  official "exemplification" at the present day of an ancient coat of arms
  (<i>e.g.</i> in an exemplification following the assumption of name and
  arms by Royal License), the mantling is painted in the livery colours,
  irrespective of any ancient patent in which "gules and argent" may have
  been <i>granted</i> as the colour of the mantling. Though probably most
  people will agree as to the expediency of such a practice, it is at any
  rate open to criticism on the score of propriety, unless the new mantling
  is expressed in terms in the new patent. This would of course amount to a
  grant overriding the earlier one, and would do all that was necessary;
  but failing this, there appears to be a distinct hiatus in the continuity
  of authority.</p>

  <p>Ermine linings to the mantling were soon denied to the undistinguished
  commoner, and with the exception of the early Garter plates, it would be
  difficult to point to an instance of their use. The mantlings of peers,
  however, continued to be lined with ermine, and English instances under
  official sanction can be found in the Visitation Books and in the Garter
  plates until a comparatively recent period. In fact the relegation of
  peers to the ordinary livery colours for their mantlings is, in England,
  quite a modern practice. In Scotland, however, the mantlings of peers
  have always been lined with ermine, and the present Lyon continues this
  whilst usually making the colours of the outside of the mantlings agree
  with the principal colour of the arms. This, as regards the outer colour
  of the mantling, is not a fixed or stereotyped rule, and in some cases
  Lyon has preferred to adopt a mantling of gules lined with ermine as more
  comformable to a peer's Parliamentary Robe of Estate.</p>

  <p>In the Deputy Earl-Marshal's warrant referred to on page <a
  href="#page375">375</a> are some interesting points as to the mantling.
  It is recited that "some persons under y<sup>e</sup> degree of
  y<sup>e</sup> Nobilitie of this Realme doe cause Ermins to be Depicted
  upon ye Lineings of those Mantles which are used with their Armes, and
  also that there are some that have lately caused the Mantles of their
  Armes to be painted like Ostrich feathers as tho' they were of some
  peculiar and superior degree of Honor," and the warrant commands that
  these points are to be rectified.</p>

  <p>The Royal mantling is of cloth of gold. In the case of the sovereign
  and the Prince of Wales it is lined with ermine, and for other members of
  the Royal Family it is lined with argent. Queen Elizabeth was the first
  sovereign to adopt the golden mantling, the Royal tinctures before that
  date (for the mantling) being gules lined ermine. The mantling of or and
  ermine has, of course, since that date been rigidly denied to <!-- Page
  392 --><span class="pagenum" title="442.png"><a
  name="page392"></a>{392}</span>all outside the Royal Family. Two
  instances, however, occur amongst the early Garter plates, viz. Sir John
  Grey de Ruthyn and Frederick, Duke of Urbino. It is sometimes stated that
  a mantling of or and ermine is a sign of sovereignty, but the mantling of
  our own sovereign is really the only case in which it is presently so
  used.</p>

  <p>In Sweden, as in Scotland, the colours of the mantling are specified
  in the patent, and, unlike our own, are often curiously varied.</p>

  <p>The present rules for the colour of a mantling are as follows in
  England and Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. That with ancient arms of which the grant specified the colour,
  where this has not been altered by a subsequent exemplification, the
  colours must be as stated in the grant, <i>i.e.</i> usually gules, lined
  argent.</p>

  <p>2. That the mantling of the sovereign and Prince of Wales is of cloth
  of gold, lined with ermine.</p>

  <p>3. That the mantling of other members of the Royal Family is of cloth
  of gold lined with argent.</p>

  <p>4. That the mantlings of all other people shall be of the livery
  colours.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The rules in Scotland are now as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. That in the cases of peers whose arms were matriculated before 1890
  the mantling is of gules lined with ermine (the Scottish term for "lined"
  is "doubled").</p>

  <p>2. That the mantlings of all other arms matriculated before 1890 shall
  be of gules and argent.</p>

  <p>3. That the mantlings of peers whose arms have been matriculated since
  1890 shall be either of the principal colour of the arms, lined with
  ermine, or of gules lined ermine (conformably to the Parliamentary Robe
  of Estate of a peer) as may happen to have been matriculated.</p>

  <p>4. That the mantlings of all other persons whose arms have been
  matriculated since 1890 shall be of the livery colours, unless other
  colours are, as is occasionally the case, specified in the patent of
  matriculation.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whether in Scotland a person is entitled to assume of his own motion
  an ermine lining to his mantling upon his elevation to the peerage,
  without a rematriculation in cases where the arms and mantling have been
  otherwise matriculated at an earlier date, or whether in England any peer
  may still line his mantling with ermine, are points on which one
  hesitates to express an opinion.</p>

  <p>When the mantling is of the livery colours the following rules must be
  observed. The outside must be of some colour and the lining of some
  metal. The colour must be the principal colour of the arms, <!-- Page 393
  --><span class="pagenum" title="443.png"><a
  name="page393"></a>{393}</span><i>i.e.</i> the colour of the field if it
  be of colour, or if it is of metal, then the colour of the principal
  ordinary or charge upon the shield. The metal will be as the field, if
  the field is of metal, or if not, it will be as the metal of the
  principal ordinary or charge. In other words, it should be the same
  tinctures as the wreath.</p>

  <p>If the field is party of colour and metal (<i>i.e.</i> per pale barry,
  quarterly, &amp;c.), then that colour and that metal are "the livery
  colours." If the field is party of two <i>colours</i> the principal
  colour (<i>i.e.</i> the one first mentioned in the blazon) is taken as
  the colour and the other is ignored. The mantling is <i>not</i> made
  party to agree with the field in British heraldry, as would be the case
  in Germany. If the field is of a fur, then the dominant metal or colour
  of the fur is taken as one component part of the "livery colours," the
  other metal or colour required being taken from the next most important
  tincture of the field. For example, "ermine, a fess gules" has a mantling
  of gules and argent, whilst "or, a chevron ermines" would need a mantling
  of sable and or. The mantling for "azure, a lion rampant erminois" would
  be azure and or. But in a coat showing fur, metal, and colour, sometimes
  the fur is ignored. A field of vair has a mantling argent and azure, but
  if the charge be vair the field will supply the one, <i>i.e.</i> either
  colour or metal, whilst the vair supplies whichever is lacking. Except in
  the cases of Scotsmen who are peers and of the Sovereign and Prince of
  Wales, no fur is ever used nowadays in Great Britain for a mantling.</p>

  <p>In cases where the principal charge is "proper," a certain discretion
  must be used. Usually the heraldic colour to which the charge
  approximates is used. For example, "argent, issuing from a mount in base
  a tree proper," &amp;c., would have a mantling vert and argent. The arms
  "or, three Cornish choughs proper," or "argent, three negroes' heads
  couped proper," would have mantlings respectively sable and or and sable
  and argent. Occasionally one comes across a coat which supplies an
  "impossible" mantling, or which does not supply one at all. Such a coat
  would be "per bend sinister ermine and erminois, a lion rampant
  counterchanged." Here there is no colour at all, so the mantling would be
  gules and argent. "Argent, three stags trippant proper" would have a
  mantling gules and argent. A coat of arms with a landscape field would
  also probably be supplied (in default of a chief, <i>e.g.</i> supplying
  other colours and tinctures) with a mantling gules and argent. It is
  quite permissible to "vein" a mantling with gold lines, this being always
  done in official paintings.</p>

  <p>In English official heraldry, where, no matter how great the number of
  crests, one helmet only is painted, it naturally follows that one
  mantling only can be depicted. This is always taken from the livery
  colours of the chief (<i>i.e.</i> the first) quartering or
  sub-quartering. <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum" title="444.png"><a
  name="page394"></a>{394}</span>In Scottish patents at the present day in
  which a helmet is painted for each crest the mantlings frequently vary,
  being in each case in accordance with the livery colours of the
  quartering to which the crest belongs. Consequently this must be accepted
  as the rule in cases where more than one helmet is shown.</p>

  <p>In considering the fashionings of mantlings it must be remembered that
  styles and fashions much overlap, and there has always been the tendency
  in armory to repeat earlier styles. Whilst one willingly concedes the
  immense gain in beauty by the present reversion in heraldic art to older
  and better, and certainly more artistic types, there is distinctly
  another side to the question which is strangely overlooked by those who
  would have the present-day heraldic art slavishly copied in all minutiæ
  of detail, and even (according to some) in all the crudity of
  draughtmanship from examples of the earliest periods.</p>

  <p>Hitherto each period of heraldic art has had its own peculiar style
  and type, each within limits readily recognisable. Whether that style and
  type can be considered when judged by the canons of art to be good or
  bad, there can be no doubt that each style in its turn has approximated
  to, and has been in keeping with, the concurrent decorative art outside
  and beyond heraldry, though it has always exhibited a tendency to rather
  lag behind. When all has been said and done that can be, heraldry, in
  spite of its symbolism and its many other meanings, remains but a form of
  decorative art; and therefore it is natural that it should be influenced
  by other artistic ideas and other manifestations of art and accepted
  forms of design current at the period to which it belongs. For, from the
  artistic point of view, the part played in art by heraldry is so limited
  in extent compared with the part occupied by other forms of decoration,
  that one would naturally expect heraldry to show the influence of outside
  decorative art to a greater extent than decorative art as a whole would
  be likely to show the influence of heraldry. In our present revulsion of
  mind in favour of older heraldic types, we are apt to speak of "good" or
  "bad" heraldic art. But art itself cannot so be divided, for after all
  allowances have been made for crude workmanship, and when bad or
  imperfect examples have been eliminated from consideration (and given
  always necessarily the essential basis of the relation of line to curve
  and such technical details of art), who on earth is to judge, or who is
  competent to say, whether any particular style of art is good or bad? No
  one from preference executes speculative art which he knows whilst
  executing it to be bad. Most manifestations of art, and peculiarly of
  decorative art, are commercial matters executed with the frank idea of
  subsequent sale, and consequently with the subconscious idea, true though
  but seldom acknowledged, of pleasing that public which will <!-- Page 395
  --><span class="pagenum" title="445.png"><a
  name="page395"></a>{395}</span>have to buy. Consequently the ultimate
  appeal is to the taste of the public, for art, if it be not the desire to
  give pleasure by the representation of beauty, is nothing. Beauty, of
  course, must not necessarily be confounded with prettiness; it may be
  beauty of character. The result is, therefore, that the decorative art of
  any period is an indication of that which gives pleasure at the moment,
  and an absolute reflex of the artistic wishes, desires, and tastes of the
  cultivated classes to whom executive art must appeal. At every period it
  has been found that this taste is constantly changing, and as a
  consequence the examples of decorative art of any period are a reflex
  only of the artistic ideas current at the time the work was done.</p>

  <p>At all periods, therefore, even during the early Victorian period,
  which we are now taught and believe to be the most ghastly period through
  which English art has passed, the art in vogue has been what the public
  have admired, and have been ready to pay for, and most emphatically what
  they have been taught and brought up to consider good art. In early
  Victorian days there was no lack of educated people, and because they
  liked the particular form of decoration associated with their period, who
  is justified in saying that, because that peculiar style of decoration is
  not acceptable now to ourselves, their art was bad, and worse than our
  own? If throughout the ages there had been one dominating style of
  decoration equally accepted at all periods and by all authorities as the
  highest type of decorative art, then we should have some standard to
  judge by. Such is not the case, and we have no such standard, and any
  attempt to arbitrarily create and control ideas between given parallel
  lines of arbitrary thought, when the ideas are constantly changing, is
  impossible and undesirable. Who dreams of questioning the art of
  Benvenuto Cellini, or of describing his craftsmanship as other than one
  of the most vivid examples of his period, and yet what had it in keeping
  with the art of the Louis XVI. period, or the later art of William Morris
  and his followers? Widely divergent as are these types, they are
  nevertheless all accepted as the highest expressions of three separate
  types of decorative art. Any one attempting to compare them, or to rank
  these schools of artistic thought in order of superiority, would simply
  be laying themselves open to ridicule unspeakable, for they would be
  ranked by the highest authorities of different periods in different
  orders, and it is as impossible to create a permanent standard of art as
  it is impossible to ensure a permanence of any particular public taste.
  The fact that taste changes, and as a consequence that artistic styles
  and types vary, is simply due to the everlasting desire on the part of
  the public for some new thing, and their equally permanent appreciation
  of novelty of idea or sensation. That master-minds have arisen to teach,
  and <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum" title="446.png"><a
  name="page396"></a>{396}</span>that they have taught with some success
  their own particular brand of art to the public, would seem rather to
  argue against the foregoing ideas were it not that, when the master-mind
  and the dominating influence are gone, the public, desiring as always
  change and novelty, are ready to fly to any new teacher and master who
  can again afford them artistic pleasure. The influence of William Morris
  in household decoration is possibly the most far-reaching modern example
  of the influence of a single man upon the art of his period; but
  master-mind as was his, and master-craftsman as he was, it has needed but
  a few years since his death to start the undoing of much that he taught.
  After the movement initiated by Morris and carried further by the Arts
  and Crafts Society, which made for simplicity in structural design as
  well as in the decoration of furniture, we have now fallen back upon the
  flowery patterns of the early Victorian period, and there is hardly a
  drawing-room in fashionable London where the chairs and settees are not
  covered with early Victorian chintzes.</p>

  <p>Artistic authorities may shout themselves hoarse, but the fashion
  having been set in Mayfair will be inevitably followed in Suburbia, and
  we are doubtless again at the beginning of the cycle of that curious
  manifestation of domestic decorative art which was current in the early
  part of the nineteenth century. It is, therefore, evident that it is
  futile to describe varying types of art of varying periods as good or
  bad, or to differentiate between them, unless some such permanent basis
  of comparison or standard of excellence be conceded. The differing types
  must be accepted as no more than the expression of the artistic period to
  which they belong. That being so, one cannot help thinking that the abuse
  which has been heaped of late (by unthinking votaries of Plantagenet and
  Tudor heraldry) upon heraldic art in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
  nineteenth centuries has very greatly overstepped the true proportion of
  the matter. Much that has been said is true, but what has been said too
  often lacks proportion. There is consequently much to be said in favour
  of allowing each period to create its own style and type of heraldic
  design, in conformity with the ideas concerning decorative art which are
  current outside heraldic thought. This is precisely what is not happening
  at the present time, even with all our boasted revival of armory and
  armorial art. The tendency at the present time is to slavishly copy
  examples of other periods. There is another point which is usually
  overlooked by the most blatant followers of this school of thought. What
  are the ancient models which remain to us? The early Rolls of Arms of
  which we hear so much are not, and were never intended to be, examples of
  artistic execution. They are merely memoranda of <i>fact</i>. It is
  absurd to suppose that an actual shield was painted with the crudity to
  be met <!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum" title="447.png"><a
  name="page397"></a>{397}</span>with in the Rolls of Arms. It is equally
  absurd to accept as unimpeachable models, Garter plates, seals, or
  architectural examples unless the purpose and medium&mdash;wax, enamel,
  or stone&mdash;in which they are executed is borne in mind, and the
  knowledge used with due discrimination. Mr. Eve, without slavishly
  copying, originally appears to have modelled his work upon the admirable
  designs and ideas of the "little masters" of German art in the sixteenth
  and seventeenth centuries. He has since progressed therefrom to a
  distinctive and very excellent style of his own. Mr. Graham Johnson
  models his work upon Plantagenet and Tudor examples. The work of Père
  Anselm, and of Pugin, the first start towards the present ideas of
  heraldic art, embodying as it did so much of the beauty of the older work
  whilst possessing a character of its own, and developing ancient ideals
  by increased beauty of execution, has placed their reputation far above
  that of others, who, following in their footsteps, have not possessed
  their abilities. But with regard to most of the heraldic design of the
  present day as a whole it is very evident that we are simply picking and
  choosing tit-bits from the work of bygone craftsmen, and copying, more or
  less slavishly, examples of other periods. This makes for no advance in
  design either, in its character or execution, nor will it result in any
  peculiarity of style which it will be possible in the future to identify
  with the present period. Our heraldry, like our architecture, though it
  may be dated in the twentieth century, will be a heterogeneous collection
  of isolated specimens of Gothic, Tudor, or Queen Anne style and type,
  which surely is as anachronistic as we consider to be those Dutch
  paintings which represent Christ and the Apostles in modern clothes.</p>

  <p>Roughly the periods into which the types of mantlings can be divided,
  when considered from the standpoint of their fashioning, are somewhat as
  follows. There is the earliest period of all, when the mantling depicted
  approximated closely if it was not an actual representation of the
  capelote really worn in battle. Examples of this will be found in the
  <i>Armorial de Gelre</i> and the Zurich <i>Wappenrolle</i>. As the
  mantling worn lengthened and evolved itself into the lambrequin, the
  mantling depicted in heraldic art was similarly increased in size,
  terminating in the long mantle drawn in profile but tasselled and with
  the scalloped edges, a type which is found surviving in some of the early
  Garter plates. This is the transition stage. The next definite period is
  when we find the mantling depicted on both sides of the helmet and the
  scalloped edges developed, in accordance with the romantic ideas of the
  period, into the slashes and cuts of the bold and artistic mantlings of
  Plantagenet armorial art.</p>

  <p>Slowly decreasing in strength, but at the same time increasing in
  elaboration, this mantling and type continued until it had reached its
  <!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum" title="448.png"><a
  name="page398"></a>{398}</span>highest pitch of exuberant elaboration in
  Stuart and early Georgian times. Side by side with this over-elaboration
  came the revulsion to a Puritan simplicity of taste which is to be found
  in other manifestations of art at the same time, and which made itself
  evident in heraldic decoration by the use as mantling of the plain uncut
  cloth suspended behind the shield. Originating in Elizabethan days, this
  plain cloth was much made use of, but towards the end of the Stuart
  period came that curious evolution of British heraldry which is peculiar
  to these countries alone. That is the entire omission of both helmet and
  mantling. How it originated it is difficult to understand, unless it be
  due to the fact that a large number, in fact a large proportion, of
  English families possessed a shield only and neither claimed nor used a
  crest, and that consequently a large number of heraldic representations
  give the shield only. It is rare indeed to find a shield surmounted by
  helmet and mantling when the former is not required to support a crest.
  At the same time we find, among the official records of the period, that
  the documents of chief importance were the Visitation Books. In these,
  probably from motives of economy or to save needless draughtsmanship, the
  trouble of depicting the helmet and mantling was dispensed with, and the
  crest is almost universally found depicted on the wreath, which is made
  to rest upon the shield, the helmet being omitted. That being an accepted
  official way of representing an achievement, small wonder that the public
  followed, and we find as a consequence that a large proportion of the
  bookplates during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had no helmet
  or mantling at all, the elaboration of the edges of the shield, together
  with the addition of decorative and needless accessories bearing no
  relation to the arms, fulfilling all purposes of decorative design. It
  should also be remembered that from towards the close of the Stuart
  period onward, England was taking her art and decoration almost entirely
  from Continental sources, chiefly French and Italian. In both the
  countries the use of crests was very limited indeed in extent, and the
  elimination of the helmet and mantling, and the elaboration in their
  stead of the edges of the shield, we probably owe to the effort to
  assimilate French and Italian forms of decoration to English arms. So
  obsolete had become the use of helmet and mantling that it is difficult
  to come across examples that one can put forward as mantlings typical of
  the period.</p>

  <p>Helmets and mantlings were of course painted upon grants and upon the
  Stall plates of the knights of the various orders, but whilst the helmets
  became weak, of a pattern impossible to wear, and small in size, the
  mantling became of a stereotyped pattern, and of a design poor and wooden
  according to our present ideas.</p>

  <p>Unofficial heraldry had sunk to an even lower style of art, and <!--
  Page 399 --><span class="pagenum" title="451.png"><a
  name="page399"></a>{399}</span>the regulation heraldic stationer's types
  of shield, mantling, and helmet are awe-inspiring in their ugliness.</p>

  <p>The term "mantle" is sometimes employed, but it would seem hardly
  quite correctly, to the parliamentary robe of estate upon which the arms
  of a peer of the realm were so frequently depicted at the end of the
  eighteenth and in the early part of the nineteenth centuries. Its
  popularity is an indication of the ever-constant predilection for
  something which is denied to others and the possession of which is a
  matter of privilege. Woodward, in his "Treatise on Heraldry," treats of
  and dismisses the matter in one short sentence: "In England the
  suggestion that the arms of peers should be mantled with their Parliament
  robes was never generally adopted." In this statement he is quite
  incorrect, for as the accepted type in one particular opportunity of
  armorial display its use was absolutely universal. The opportunity in
  question was the emblazonment of arms upon carriage panels. In the early
  part of the nineteenth and at the end of the eighteenth centuries
  armorial bearings were painted of some size upon carriages, and there
  were few such paintings executed for the carriages, chariots, and state
  coaches of peers that did not appear upon a background of the robe of
  estate. With the modern craze for ostentatious unostentation (the result,
  there can be little doubt, in this respect of the wholesale appropriation
  of arms by those without a right to bear these ornaments), the decoration
  of a peer's carriage nowadays seldom shows more than a simple coronet, or
  a coroneted crest, initial, or monogram; but the State chariots of those
  who still possess them almost all, without exception, show the arms
  emblazoned upon the robe of estate. The Royal and many other State
  chariots made or refurbished for the recent coronation ceremonies show
  that, when an opportunity of the fullest display properly arises, the
  robe of estate is not yet a thing of the past. Fig. 665 is from a
  photograph of a carriage panel, and shows the arms of a former
  Marchioness of Cholmondeley displayed in this manner. Incidentally it
  also shows a practice frequently resorted to, but quite unauthorised, of
  taking one supporter from the husband's shield and the other (when the
  wife was an heiress) from the arms of her family. The arms are those of
  Georgiana Charlotte, widow of George James, first Marquess of
  Cholmondeley, and younger daughter and coheir of Peregrine, third Duke of
  Ancaster. She became a widow in 1827 and died in 1838, so the panel must
  have been painted between those dates. The arms shown are: "Quarterly, 1
  and 4, gules, in chief two esquires' helmets proper, and in base a garb
  or (for Cholmondeley); 2. gules, a chevron between three eagles' heads
  erased argent; 3. or, on a fesse between two chevrons sable, three cross
  crosslets or (for Walpole), and on an <!-- Page 400 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="452.png"><a
  name="page400"></a>{400}</span>escutcheon of pretence the arms of Bertie,
  namely: argent, three battering-rams fesswise in pale proper, headed and
  garnished azure." The supporters shown are: "Dexter, a griffin sable,
  armed, winged, and membered or (from the Cholmondeley achievement);
  sinister, a friar vested in russet with staff and rosary or" (one of the
  supporters belonging to the Barony of Willoughby D'Eresby, to which the
  Marchioness of Cholmondeley in her own right was a coheir until the
  abeyance in the Barony was determined in favour of her elder sister).</p>

  <p>"In later times the arms of sovereigns&mdash;the German Electors,
  &amp;c.&mdash;were mantled, usually with crimson velvet fringed with
  gold, lined with ermine, and crowned; but the mantling armoyé was one of
  the marks of dignity used by the Pairs de France, and by Cardinals
  resident in France; it was also employed by some great nobles in other
  countries. The mantling of the Princes and Dukes of Mirandola was chequy
  argent and azure, lined with ermine. In France the mantling of the
  Chancelier was of cloth of gold; that of Présidents, of scarlet, lined
  with alternate strips of ermine and <i>petit gris</i>. In France,
  Napoleon I., who used a mantling of purple semé of golden bees, decreed
  that the princes and grand dignitaries should use an azure mantling thus
  semé; those of Dukes were to be plain, and lined with vair instead of
  ermine. In 1817 a mantling of azure, fringed with gold and lined with
  ermine, was appropriated to the dignity of Pair de France."</p>

  <p>The pavilion is a feature of heraldic art which is quite unknown to
  British heraldry, and one can call to mind no single instance of its use
  in this country; but as its use is very prominent in Germany and other
  countries, it cannot be overlooked. It is confined to the arms of
  sovereigns, and the pavilion is the tent-like erection within which the
  heraldic achievement is displayed. The pavilion seems to have originated
  in France, where it can be traced back upon the Great Seals of the kings
  to its earliest form and appearance upon the seal of Louis XI. In the
  case of the Kings of France, it was of azure semé-de-lis or. The pavilion
  used with the arms of the German Emperor is of gold semé alternately of
  Imperial crowns and eagles displayed sable, and is lined with ermine. The
  motto is carried on a crimson band, and it is surmounted by the Imperial
  crown, and a banner of the German colours gules, argent, and sable. The
  pavilion used by the German Emperor as King of Prussia is of crimson,
  semé of black eagles and gold crowns, and the band which carries the
  motto is blue. The pavilions of the King of Bavaria and the Duke of
  Baden, the King of Saxony, the Duke of Hesse, the Duke of
  Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the Duke of <!--
  Page 401 --><span class="pagenum" title="453.png"><a
  name="page401"></a>{401}</span>SaxeMeiningen-Hildburghausen, the Duke of
  Saxe-Altenburg, and the Duke of Anhalt are all of crimson.</p>

  <p>In German heraldry a rather more noticeable distinction is drawn than
  with ourselves between the lambrequin (<i>Helmdecke</i>) and the mantle
  (<i>Helmmantel</i>). This more closely approximates to the robe of
  estate, though the <i>helmmantel</i> has not in Germany the rigid
  significance of peerage degree that the robe of estate has in this
  country. The German <i>helmmantel</i> with few exceptions is always of
  purple lined with ermine, and whilst the mantel always falls directly
  from the coronet or cap, the pavilion is arranged in a dome-like form
  which bears the crown upon its summit. The pavilion is supposed to be the
  invention of the Frenchman Philip Moreau (1680), and found its way from
  France to Germany, where both in the Greater and Lesser Courts it was
  enthusiastically adopted. Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, Spain,
  Portugal, and Würtemberg are the only Royal Arms in which the pavilion
  does not figure. <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum" title="454.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXV</h5>

<h5>THE TORSE, OR WREATH</h5>

  <p>The actual helmet, from the very <i>earliest</i> heraldic
  representations which have come down to us, would sometimes appear not to
  have had any mantling, the crest being affixed direct to the (then) flat
  top of the helmet in use. But occasional crests appear very early in the
  existence of "ordered" armory, and at much about the same time we find
  the "textile" covering of the helmet coming into heraldic use. In the
  earliest times we find that frequently the crest itself was continued
  into the mantling. But where this was not possible, the attaching of the
  crest to the helmet when the mantling intervened left an unsightly
  joining. The unsightliness very soon called forth a remedy. At first this
  remedy took the form of a coronet or a plain fillet or ribbon round the
  point of juncture, sometimes with and sometimes without the ends being
  visible. If the ends were shown they were represented as floating behind,
  sometimes with and sometimes without a representation of the bow or knot
  in which they were tied. The plain fillet still continued to be used long
  after the torse had come into recognised use. The consideration of crest
  coronets has been already included, but with regard to the wreath an
  analysis of the Plantagenet Garter plates will afford some definite basis
  from which to start deduction.</p>

  <p>Of the eighty-six achievements reproduced in Mr. St. John Hope's book,
  five have no crest. Consequently we have eighty-one examples to analyse.
  Of these there are ten in which the crest is not attached to the
  lambrequin and helmet by anything perceptible, eight are attached with
  fillets of varying widths, twenty-one crests are upon chapeaux, and
  twenty-nine issue from coronets. But at no period governed by the series
  is it possible that either fillet, torse, chapeau, or coronet was in use
  to the exclusion of another form. This remark applies more particularly
  to the fillet and torse (the latter of which undoubtedly at a later date
  superseded the former), for both at the beginning and at the end of the
  series referred to we find the fillet and the wreath or torse, and at
  both periods we find crests without either coronet, torse, chapeau, or
  fillet. The fillet must soon afterwards (in the fifteenth century) have
  completely fallen into desuetude. <!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum" title="455.png"
  ><a name="page403"></a>{403}</span>The torse was so small and unimportant
  a matter that upon seals it would probably equally escape the attention
  of the engraver and the observer, and probably there would be little to
  be gained by a systematic hunt through early seals to discover the date
  of its introduction, but it will be noticed that no wreaths appear in
  some of the early Rolls. General Leigh says, "In the time of Henry the
  Fifth, and long after, no man had his badge set on a wreath under the
  degree of a knight. But that order is worn away." It probably belongs to
  the end of the fourteenth century. There can be little doubt that its
  twisted shape was an evolution from the plain fillet suggested by the
  turban of the East. We read in the old romances, in Mallory's "Morte
  d'Arthur" and elsewhere, of valiant knights who in battle or tournament
  wore the favour of some lady, or even the lady's sleeve, upon their
  helmets. It always used to be a puzzle to me how the sleeve could have
  been worn upon the helmet, and I wonder how many of the present-day
  novelists, who so glibly make their knightly heroes of olden time wear
  the "favours" of their lady-lovers, know how it was done? The favour did
  not take the place of the crest. A knight did not lightly discard an
  honoured, inherited, and known crest for the sake of wearing a favour
  only too frequently the mere result of a temporary flirtation; nor to
  wear her colours could he at short notice discard or renew his
  lambrequin, surcoat, or the housings and trappings of his horse. He
  simply took the favour&mdash;the colours, a ribbon, or a handkerchief of
  the lady, as the case might be&mdash;and twisted it in and out or over
  and over the fillet which surrounded the joining-place of crest and
  helmet. To put her favour on his helmet was the work of a moment. The
  wearing of a lady's sleeve, which must have been an honour greatly
  prized, is of course the origin of the well-known "maunch," the solitary
  charge in the arms of Conyers, Hastings, and Wharton. Doubtless the
  sleeve twined with the fillet would be made to encircle the base of the
  crest, and it is not unlikely that the wide hanging mouth of the sleeve
  might have been used for the lambrequin. The dresses of ladies at that
  period were decorated with the arms of their families, so in each case
  would be of the "colours" of the lady, so that the sleeve and its colours
  would be quickly identified, as it was no doubt usually intended they
  should be. The accidental result of twining a favour in the fillet, in
  conjunction with the pattern obviously suggested by the turban of the
  East, produced the conventional torse or wreath. As the conventional
  slashings of the lambrequin hinted at past hard fighting in battle, so
  did the conventional torse hint at past service to and favour of ladies,
  love and war being the occupations of the perfect knight of romance. How
  far short of the ideal knight of <!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum" title="456.png"
  ><a name="page404"></a>{404}</span>romance the knight of fact fell,
  perhaps the frequent bordures and batons of heraldry are the best
  indication. At first, as is evident from the Garter plates, the colours
  of the torse seem to have had little or no compulsory relation to the
  "livery colours" of the arms. The instances to be gleaned from the
  Plantagenet Garter plates which have been reproduced are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Sir John Bourchier, Lord Bourchier. Torse: sable and vert. Arms:
  argent and gules.</p>

  <p>Sir John Grey, Earl of Tankerville. Torse: vert, gules, and argent.
  Arms: gules and argent.</p>

  <p>Sir Lewis Robsart, Lord Bourchier. Torse: azure, or, and sable. Arms:
  vert and or. [The crest, derived from his wife (who was a daughter of
  Lord Bourchier) is practically the same as the one first quoted. It will
  be noticed that the torse differs.]</p>

  <p>Sir Edward Cherleton, Lord Cherleton of Powis. Torse: gules and sable.
  Arms: or and gules.</p>

  <p>Sir Gaston de Foix, Count de Longueville. Torse: or and gules. Arms:
  or and gules.</p>

  <p>Sir William Nevill, Lord Fauconberg. Torse: argent and gules. Arms:
  gules and argent.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Wydville, Lord Rivers. Torse: vert. Arms: argent and
  gules.</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Bourchier, Earl of Essex. Torse: sable and vert. Arms:
  argent and gules. [This is the same crest above alluded to.]</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas Stanley, Lord Stanley. Torse: or and azure. Arms: or and
  azure.</p>

  <p>Sir John Bourchier, Lord Berners. Torse: gules and argent. Arms:
  argent and gules. [This is the same crest above alluded to.]</p>

  <p>Sir Walter Devereux, Lord Ferrers. Torse: argent and sable. Arms:
  argent and gules. [The crest really issues from a coronet upon a torse in
  a previous case, this crest issues from a torse only.]</p>

  <p>Sir Francis Lovel, Viscount Lovel. Torse: azure and or. Arms: or and
  gules.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas Burgh, Lord Burgh. Torse: azure and sable. Arms: azure and
  ermine.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Tunstall, K.G. Torse: argent and sable. Arms: sable and
  argent.</p>

  <p>I can suggest no explanation of these differences unless it be, which
  is not unlikely, that they perpetuate "favours" worn; or perhaps a more
  likely supposition is that the wreath or torse was of the "family
  colours," as these were actually worn by the servants or retainers of
  each person. If this be not the case, why are the colours of the wreath
  termed the livery colours? At the present time in an English or Irish
  <!-- Page 405 --><span class="pagenum" title="457.png"><a
  name="page405"></a>{405}</span>grant of arms the colours are not
  specified, but the crest is stated to be "on a wreath of the colours." In
  Scotland, however, the crest is granted in the following words: "and upon
  a wreath of his liveries is set for crest." Consequently, I have very
  little doubt, the true state of the case is that originally the wreath
  was depicted of the colours of the livery which was worn. Then new
  families came into prominence and eminence, and had no liveries to
  inherit. They were granted arms and chose the tinctures of their arms as
  their "colours," and used these colours for their personal liveries. The
  natural consequence would be in such a case that the torse, being in
  unison with the livery, was also in unison with the arms. The consequence
  is that it has become a fixed, unalterable rule in British heraldry that
  the torse shall be of the principal metal and of the principal colour of
  the arms. I know of no recent exception to this rule, the latest, as far
  as I am aware, being a grant in the early years of the eighteenth
  century. This, it is stated in the patent, was the regranting of a coat
  of foreign origin. Doubtless the formality of a grant was substituted for
  the usual registration in this case, owing to a lack of formal proof of a
  right to the arms, but there is no doubt that the peculiarities of the
  foreign arms, as they had been previously borne, were preserved in the
  grant. The peculiarity in this case consisted of a torse of three
  tinctures. The late Lyon Clerk once pointed out to me, in Lyon Register,
  an instance of a coat there matriculated with a torse of three colours,
  but I unfortunately made no note of it at the time. Woodward alludes to
  the curious chequy wreath on the seals of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany,
  in 1389. This appears to have been repeated in the seals of his son
  Murdoch.</p>

  <p>The wreath of Patrick Hepburn appears to be of roses in the Gelre
  "Armorial," and a careful examination of the plates in this volume will
  show many curious Continental instances of substitutes for the
  conventional torse. Though by no means peculiar to British heraldry,
  there can be no manner of doubt that the wreath in the United Kingdom has
  obtained a position of legalised necessity and constant usage and
  importance which exists in no other country.</p>

  <p>As has been already explained, the torse should fit closely to the
  crest, its object and purpose being merely to hide the joining of crest
  and helmet. Unfortunately in British heraldry this purpose has been
  ignored. Doubtless resulting first from the common practice of depicting
  a crest upon a wreath and without a helmet, and secondly from the fact
  that many English crests are quite unsuitable to place on a helmet, in
  fact impossible to affix by the aid of a wreath to a helmet, and thirdly
  from our ridiculous rules of position for a helmet, which result in the
  crest being depicted (in conjunction with the <!-- Page 406 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="458.png"><a
  name="page406"></a>{406}</span>representation of the helmet) in a
  position many such crests never could have occupied on any helmet, the
  effect has been to cause the wreath to lose its real form, which
  encircled the <i>helmet</i>, and to become considered as no more than a
  straight support for and relating only to the crest. When, therefore, the
  crest and its supporting basis is transferred from indefinite space to
  the helmet, the support, which is the torse, is still represented as a
  flat resting-place for the crest, and it is consequently depicted as a
  straight and rigid bar, balanced upon the apex of the helmet. This is now
  and for long has been the only accepted official way of depicting a
  wreath in England. Certainly this is an ungraceful and inartistic
  rendering, and a rendering far removed from any actual helmet wreath that
  can ever have been actually borne. Whilst one has no wish to defend the
  "rigid bar," which has nothing to recommend it, it is at the same time
  worth while to point out that the heraldic day of actual helmets and
  actual usage is long since over, never to be revived, and that our
  heraldry of to-day is merely decorative and pictorial. The rigid bar is
  none other than a conventionalised form of the actual torse, and is
  perhaps little more at variance with the reality than is our
  conventionalised method of depicting a lambrequin. Whilst this
  conventional torse remains the official pattern, it is hopeless to
  attempt to banish such a method of representation: but Lyon King of Arms,
  happily, will have none of it in his official register or on his patents,
  and few heraldic artists of any repute now care to so design or represent
  it. As always officially painted it must consist of six links alternately
  of metal and colour (the "livery colours" of the arms), of which the
  metal must be the first to be shown to the dexter side. The torse is now
  supposed to be and represented as a skein of coloured silk intertwined
  with a gold or silver cord. <!-- Page 407 --><span class="pagenum" title="459.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXVI</h5>

<h5>SUPPORTERS</h5>

  <p>In this country a somewhat fictitious importance has become attached
  to supporters, owing to their almost exclusive reservation to the highest
  rank. The rules which hold at the moment will be recited presently, but
  there can be no doubt that originally they were in this country little
  more than mere decorative and artistic appendages, being devised and
  altered from time to time by different artists according as the artistic
  necessities of the moment demanded. The subject of the origin of
  supporters has been very ably dealt with in "A Treatise on Heraldry" by
  Woodward and Burnett, and with all due acknowledgment I take from that
  work the subjoined extract:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Supporters are figures of living creatures placed at the side or
  sides of an armorial shield, and appearing to support it. French writers
  make a distinction, giving the name of <i>Supports</i> to animals, real
  or imaginary, thus employed; while human figures or angels similarly used
  are called <i>Tenants</i>. Trees, and other inanimate objects which are
  sometimes used, are called <i>Soutiens</i>.</p>

  <p>"Menêtrier and other old writers trace the origin of supporters to the
  usages of the tournaments, where the shields of the combatants were
  exposed for inspection, and guarded by their servants or pages disguised
  in fanciful attire: 'C'est des Tournois qu'est venu cet usage parce que
  les chevaliers y faisoient porter leurs lances, et leurs écus, par des
  pages, et des valets de pied, deguisez en ours, en lions, en mores, et en
  sauvages' (<i>Usage des Armoiries</i>, p. 119).</p>

  <p>"The old romances give us evidence that this custom prevailed; but I
  think only after the use of supporters had already arisen from another
  source.</p>

  <p>"There is really little doubt now that Anstis was quite correct when,
  in his <i>Aspilogia</i>, he attributed the origin of supporters to the
  invention of the engraver, who filled up the spaces at the top and sides
  of the triangular shield upon a circular seal with foliage, or with
  fanciful animals. Any good collection of mediæval seals will strengthen
  this conviction. For instance, the two volumes of Laing's 'Scottish
  Seals' afford numerous examples in which the shields used in the
  thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were placed between two creatures
  <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum" title="460.png"><a
  name="page408"></a>{408}</span>resembling lizards or dragons. (See the
  seal of <span class="sc">Alexander de Balliol</span>, 1295.&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Laing</span>, ii. 74.)</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The seal of John, Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the King of <span
  class="sc">France</span>, before 1316 bears his arms (<span
  class="sc">France-Ancient</span>, <i>a bordure gules</i>) between two
  lions rampant away from the shield, and an eagle with expanded wings
  standing above it. The <i>secretum</i> of Isabelle de <span
  class="sc">Flandres</span> (<i>c.</i> 1308) has her shield placed between
  three lions, each charged with a bend (Vrée, <i>Gen. Com. Flanr.</i>,
  Plates XLIII., XLIV., XCII.). In 1332 <span class="sc">Aymon of
  Savoy</span> places his arms (<span class="sc">Savoy</span>, <i>with a
  label</i>) between a winged lion in chief and a lion without wings at
  either side. Later, on the seal of <span class="sc">Amadeus VI.</span>, a
  lion's head between wings became the crest of <span
  class="sc">Savoy</span>. In 1332 <span class="sc">Amadeus</span> bears
  <span class="sc">Savoy</span> on a lozenge between in chief two eagles,
  in base two lions. (<span class="sc">Cibrario</span>, Nos. 61, 64; and
  <span class="sc">Guichenon</span>, tome i. No. 130.) In Scotland the
  shield of <span class="sc">Reginald Crawford</span> in 1292 is placed
  between two dogs, and surmounted by a fox; in the same year the paly
  shield of <span class="sc">Reginald</span>, Earl of <span
  class="sc">Athole</span>, appears between two lions in chief and as many
  griffins in flanks.&mdash;<span class="sc">Laing</span>, i. 210, 761.</p>

  <p>"The seal of <span class="sc">Humbert II.</span>, Dauphin de Viennois
  in 1349, is an excellent example of the fashion. The shield of <span
  class="sc">Dauphiny</span> is in the centre of a quatrefoil. Two savages
  mounted on griffins support its flanks; on the upper edge an armed knight
  sits on a couchant lion, and the space in base is filled by a human face
  between two wingless dragons. The spaces are sometimes filled with the
  Evangelistic symbols, as on the seal of <span class="sc">Yolante de
  Flandres</span>, Countess of Bar (<i>c.</i> 1340). The seal of <span
  class="sc">Jeanne</span>, Dame de <span class="sc">Plasnes</span>, in
  1376 bears her arms <i>en bannière</i> a quatrefoil supported by two
  kneeling angels, a demi-angel in chief, and a lion couchant guardant in
  base."</p>

  <p>Corporate and other seals afford countless examples of the interstices
  in the design being filled with the figures similar to those from which
  in later days the supporters of a family have been deduced. But I am
  myself convinced that the argument can be carried further. Fanciful
  ornamentation or meaningless devices may have first been made use of by
  seal engravers, but it is very soon found that the badge is in regular
  use for this purpose, and we find both animate and inanimate badges
  employed. Then where this is possible the badge, if animate, is made to
  support the helmet and crest, and, later on, the shield, and there can be
  no doubt the badge was in fact acting as a supporter long before the
  science of armory recognised that existence of supporters.</p>

  <p>Before passing to supporters proper, it may be well to briefly allude
  to various figures which are to be found in a position analogous to that
  of supporters. The single human figure entire, or in the form <!-- Page
  409 --><span class="pagenum" title="461.png"><a
  name="page409"></a>{409}</span>of a demi-figure appearing above the
  shield, is very frequently to be met with, but the addition of such
  figures <i>was and remains purely artistic</i>, and I know of no single
  instance in British armory where one figure, animate or inanimate, has
  ever existed alone in the character of a single supporter, and as an
  integral part of the heritable armorial achievement. Of course I except
  those figures upon which the arms of certain families are properly
  displayed. These will be presently alluded to, but though they are
  certainly exterior ornaments, I do not think they can be properly classed
  as supporters unless to this term is given some elasticity, or unless the
  term has some qualifying remarks of reservation added to it. There are,
  however, many instances of armorial ensigns depicted, and presumably
  correctly, in the form of banners supported by a single animal, but it
  will always be found that the single animal is but one of the pair of
  duly allocated supporters. Many instances of arms depicted in this manner
  will be found in "Prince Arthur's Book." The same method of display was
  adopted in some number of cases, and with some measure of success, in
  Foster's "Peerage." Single figures are very frequently to be met with in
  German and Continental heraldry, but on these occasions, as with
  ourselves, the position they occupy is merely that of an artistic
  accessory, and bears no inseparable relation to the heraldic achievement.
  The single exception to the foregoing statement of which I am aware is to
  be found in the arms of the Swiss Cantons. These thirteen coats are
  sometimes quartered upon one shield, but when displayed separately each
  is accompanied by a single supporter. Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, Unter-Walden,
  Glarus, and Basle all bear the supporter on the dexter side; Bern,
  Schweig, Zug, Freiburg, and Soluthurn on the sinister. Schafhausen (a
  ram) and Appenzell (a bear) place their supporters in full aspect behind
  the shield.</p>

  <p>On the corbels of Gothic architecture, shields of arms are frequently
  supported by <i>Angels</i>, which, however, cannot generally be regarded
  as heraldic appendages&mdash;being merely supposed to indicate that the
  owners have contributed to the erection of the fabric. Examples of this
  practice will be found on various ecclesiastical edifices in Scotland,
  and among others at Melrose Abbey, St. Giles', Edinburgh, and the church
  of Seton in East Lothian. An interesting instance of an angel supporting
  a shield occurs on the beautiful seal of Mary of Gueldres, Queen of James
  II. (1459); and the Privy Seal of David II., a hundred years earlier,
  exhibits a pretty design of an escutcheon charged with the ensigns of
  Scotland, and borne by two arms issuing from clouds above, indicative of
  Divine support.<a name="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> <!--

  <p>Of instances of single objects from which shields are found depending
  or supported the "Treatise on Heraldry" states:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Allusion has been made to the usage by which on vesica-shaped shields
  ladies of high rank are represented as supporting with either hand
  shields of arms. From this probably arose the use of a single supporter.
  <span class="sc">Marguerite de Courcelles</span> in 1284, and <span
  class="sc">Alix de Verdun</span> in 1311, bear in one hand a shield of
  the husband's arms, in the other one of their own. The curious seal of
  <span class="sc">Muriel</span>, Countess of <span
  class="sc">Stratherne</span>, in 1284, may be considered akin to these.
  In it the shield is supported partly by a falcon, and partly by a human
  arm issuing from the sinister side of the <i>vesica</i>, and holding the
  falcon by the jesses (<span class="sc">Laing</span>, i. 764). The early
  seal of <span class="sc">Boleslas III.</span>, King of <span
  class="sc">Poland</span>, in 1255, bears a knight holding a shield
  charged with the Polish eagle (<span class="sc">Vossberg</span>, <i>Die
  Siegel des Mittelalters</i>). In 1283 the seal of <span
  class="sc">Florent</span> of <span class="sc">Hainault</span> bears a
  warrior in chain mail supporting a shield charged with a lion impaling an
  eagle dimidiated.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>"On the seal of <span class="sc">Humphrey de Bohun</span> in 1322 the
  <i>guige</i> is held by a swan, the badge of the Earls of <span
  class="sc">Hereford</span>; and in 1356 the shield of the first Earl of
  <span class="sc">Douglas</span> is supported by a lion whose head is
  covered by the crested helm, a fashion of which there are many examples.
  A helmed lion holds the shield of <span class="sc">Magnus I.</span>, Duke
  of <span class="sc">Brunswick</span>, in 1326.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>"On the seal of <span class="sc">Jean</span>, Duc de <span
  class="sc">Berri</span>, in 1393 the supporter is a helmed swan (compare
  the armorial slab of <span class="sc">Henry</span> of <span
  class="sc">Lancaster</span>, in <span class="sc">Boutell</span>, Plate
  LXXIX.). Jean IV., Comte d'<span class="sc">Alençon</span> (1408), has a
  helmed lion sejant as supporter. In 1359 a signet of <span
  class="sc">Louis van Male</span>, Count of <span
  class="sc">Flanders</span>, bears a lion sejant, helmed and crested, and
  mantled with the arms of <span class="sc">Flanders</span> between two
  small escutcheons of <span class="sc">Nevers</span>, or the county of
  Burgundy ["Azure, billetty, a lion rampant or"], and <span
  class="sc">Rethel</span> ["Gules, two heads of rakes fesswise in pale
  or"].</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A single lion sejant, helmed and crested, bearing on its breast the
  quartered arms of <span class="sc">Burgundy</span> between two or three
  other escutcheons, was used by the Dukes up to the death of <span
  class="sc">Charles the Bold</span> in 1475. In <span
  class="sc">Litta's</span> splendid work, <i>Famiglie celebri
  Italiane</i>, the <span class="sc">Buonarotti</span> arms are supported
  by a brown dog sejant, helmed, and crested with a pair of dragon's wings
  issuing from a crest-coronet. On the seal of <span class="sc">Thomas
  Holland</span>, Earl of <span class="sc">Kent</span>, in 1380 the shield
  is buckled round the neck of the white hind lodged, the badge of his
  half-brother, <span class="sc">Richard II.</span> Single supporters were
  very much in favour in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and the
  examples are numerous. <!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum" title="463.png"
  ><a name="page411"></a>{411}</span><span class="sc">Charles</span>,
  Dauphin de <span class="sc">Viennois</span> (<i>c.</i> 1355), has his
  shield held by a single dolphin. In 1294 the seal of the Dauphin <span
  class="sc">Jean</span>, son of <span class="sc">Humbert I.</span>, bears
  the arms of <span class="sc">Dauphiné</span> pendent from the neck of a
  griffon. The shields of arms of <span class="sc">Bertrand de
  Bricquebec</span>, in 1325; <span class="sc">Pierre de Tournebu</span>,
  in 1339; of <span class="sc">Charles</span>, Count of <span
  class="sc">Alençon</span>, in 1356; and of <span class="sc">Oliver de
  Clisson</span> in 1397, are supported by a warrior who stands behind the
  shield. In England the seal of <span class="sc">Henry Percy</span>, first
  Earl, in 1346, and another in 1345, have similar representations.</p>

  <p>"On several of our more ancient seals only one supporter is
  represented, and probably the earliest example of this arrangement occurs
  on the curious seal of William, first Earl of Douglas (<i>c.</i> 1356),
  where the shield is supported from behind by a lion 'sejant,' <i>with his
  head in the helmet</i>, which is surmounted by the crest.</p>

  <p>"On the seal of Archibald, fourth Earl of Douglas (<i>c.</i> 1418),
  the shield is held, along with a club, in the right hand of a savage
  <i>erect</i>, who bears a helmet in his left; while on that of William,
  eighth Earl (1446), a <i>kneeling</i> savage holds a club in his right
  hand, and supports a couché shield on his left arm."</p>

  </div>

  <p>An example reproduced from Jost Amman's <i>Wappen und Stammbuch</i>,
  published at Frankfurt, 1589, will be found in Fig. 666. In this the
  figure partakes more of the character of a shield guardian than a shield
  supporter. The arms are those of "Sigmund Hagelshaimer," otherwise
  "Helt," living at Nürnberg. The arms are "Sable, on a bend argent, an
  arrow gules." The crest is the head and neck of a hound sable, continued
  into a mantling sable, lined argent. The crest is charged with a pale
  argent, and thereupon an arrow as in the arms, the arrow-head piercing
  the ear of the hound.</p>

  <p>Seated figures as supporters are rare, but one occurs in Fig. 667,
  which shows the arms of the Vöhlin family. They bear: "Argent, on a fesse
  sable, three 'P's' argent." The wings which form the crest are charged
  with the same device. This curious charge of the three letters is
  explained in the following saying:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum" title="464.png"><a name="page412"></a>{412}</span></p>

  <p>There are, however, certain exceptions to the British rule that there
  can be no single supporters, if the objects upon which shields of arms
  are displayed are accepted as supporters. It was always customary to
  display the arms of the Lord High Admiral on the sail of the ship. In the
  person of King William IV., before he succeeded to the throne, the office
  of Lord High Admiral was vested for a short time, but it had really
  fallen into desuetude at an earlier date and has not been revived again,
  so that to all intents and purposes it is now extinct, and this
  recognised method of depicting arms is consequently also extinct. But
  there is one other case which forms a unique instance which can be
  classified with no others. The arms of Campbell of Craignish are always
  represented in a curious manner, the gyronny coat of Campbell appearing
  on a shield displayed in front of a lymphad (Plate II.). What the origin
  of this practice is it would be difficult to say; probably it merely
  originated in the imaginative ideas of an artist when making a seal for
  that family, artistic reasons suggesting the display of the gyronny arms
  of Campbell in front of the lymphad of Lorne. The family, however, seem
  to have universally adopted this method of using their arms, and in the
  year 1875, when Campbell of Inverneil matriculated in Lyon Register, the
  arms were matriculated in that form. I know of no other instance of any
  such coat of arms, and this branch of the Ducal House of Campbell
  possesses armorial bearings which, from the official standpoint, are
  absolutely unique from one end of Europe to the other.</p>

  <p>In Germany the use of arms depicted in front of the eagle displayed,
  either single-headed or double-headed, is very far from being unusual.
  Whatever may have been its meaning originally in that country, there is
  no doubt that now and for some centuries past it has been accepted as
  meaning, or as indicative of, princely rank or other honours of the Holy
  Roman Empire. But I do not think it can always have had that meaning.
  About the same date the Earl of Menteith placed his shield on the breast
  of an eagle, as did Alexander, Earl of Ross, in 1338; and in 1394 we find
  the same ornamentation in the seal of Euphemia, Countess of Ross. The
  shield of Ross is borne in her case on the breast of an eagle, while the
  arms of Leslie and Comyn appear on its displayed wings. On several other
  Scottish seals of the same era, the shield is placed on the breast of a
  displayed eagle, as on those of Alexander Abernethy and Alexander Cumin
  of Buchan (1292), and Sir David Lindsay, Lord of Crawford. English
  heraldry supplies several similar examples, of which we may mention the
  armorial insignia of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother of Henry III.,
  and of the ancient family of Latham, in the fourteenth century. A curious
  instance of a shield placed on the breast of a <i>hawk</i> is noticed by
  Hone in his "Table <!-- Page 413 --><span class="pagenum" title="467.png"
  ><a name="page413"></a>{413}</span>Book," viz. the arms of the Lord of
  the Manor of Stoke-Lyne, in the county of Oxford. It appears therefrom
  that when Charles I. held his Parliament at Oxford, the offer of
  knighthood was gratefully declined by the then Lord of Stoke-Lyne, who
  merely requested, and obtained, the Royal permission to place the arms of
  his family upon the breast of a hawk, which has ever since been employed
  in the capacity of single supporter. What authority exists for this
  statement it is impossible to ascertain, and one must doubt its accuracy,
  because in England at any rate no arms, allocated to any particular
  <i>territorial estate</i>, have ever received official recognition.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In later years, as indicative of rank in the Holy Roman Empire, the
  eagle has been rightly borne by the first Duke of Marlborough and by
  Henrietta his daughter, Duchess of Marlborough, but the use of the eagle
  by the later Dukes of Marlborough would appear to be entirely without
  authority, inasmuch as the princedom, created in the person of the first
  duke, became extinct on his death. His daughters, though entitled of
  right to the courtesy rank of princess and its accompanying privilege of
  the right to use the eagle displayed behind their arms, could not
  transmit it to their descendants upon whom the title of Duke of
  Marlborough was specially entailed by English Act of Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Denbigh and several members of the Fielding family have
  often made use of it with their arms, in token of their supposed descent
  from the Counts of Hapsburg, which, if correct, would apparently confer
  the right upon them. This descent, however, has been much questioned, and
  in late years the claim thereto would seem to have been practically
  dropped. The late Earl Cowper, the last remaining Prince of the Holy
  Roman Empire in the British Peerage, was entitled to use the double eagle
  behind his shield, being the descendant and representative of George
  Nassau Clavering Cowper, third Earl Cowper, created a Prince of the Holy
  Roman Empire by the Emperor Joseph II., the patent being dated at Vienna,
  31st January 1778, and this being followed by a Royal Licence from King
  George III. to accept and bear the title in this country.</p>

  <p>There are some others who have the right by reason of honours of
  lesser rank of the Holy Roman Empire, and amongst these may be mentioned
  Lord Methuen, who bears the eagle by Royal Warrant dated 4th April 1775.
  Sir Thomas Arundel, who served in the Imperial army of Hungary, having in
  an engagement with the Turks near Strignum taken their standard with his
  own hands, was by Rodolph II. created Count of the Empire to hold for him
  and the heirs of his body for ever, dated at Prague 14th December 1595.
  This patent, of course, means that every one of his descendants in the
  male <!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum" title="468.png"><a
  name="page414"></a>{414}</span>line has the rank of a Count of the
  Empire, and that every daughter of any such male descendant is a
  Countess, but this does not confer the rank of count or countess upon
  descendants of the daughters. It was this particular patent of creation
  that called forth the remark from Queen Elizabeth that she would not have
  her sheep branded by any foreign shepherd, and we believe that this
  patent was the origin of the rule translated in later times (<i>temp.</i>
  George IV.) into a definite Royal Warrant, requiring that no English
  subject shall, without the express Royal Licence of the Sovereign
  conveyed in writing, accept or wear any foreign title or decoration. No
  Royal Licence was subsequently obtained by the Arundel family, who
  therefore, according to British law, are denied the use of the privileged
  Imperial eagle. Outside those cases in which the double eagle is used in
  this country to denote rank of the Holy Roman Empire, the usage of the
  eagle displayed behind the arms or any analogous figure is in British
  heraldry most limited.</p>

  <p>One solitary authoritative instance of the use of the displayed eagle
  is found in the coat of arms of the city of Perth. These arms are
  recorded in Lyon Register, having been matriculated for that Royal Burgh
  about the year 1672. The official blazon of the arms is as follows:
  "Gules ane holy lambe passant regardant staff and cross argent, with the
  banner of St. Andrew proper, all within a double tressure
  counter-flowered of the second, the escutcheon being surmounted on the
  breast of ane eagle with two necks displayed or. The motto in ane
  Escroll, 'Pro Rege Lege et Grege.'"</p>

  <p>Another instance of usage, though purely devoid of authority, occurs
  in the case of a coat of arms set up on one of the panels in the Hall of
  Lincoln's Inn. In this case the achievement is displayed on the breast of
  a single-headed eagle. What reason led to its usage in this manner I am
  quite unaware, and I have not the slightest reason for supposing it to be
  authentic. The family of Stuart-Menteith also place their arms upon a
  single-headed eagle displayed gules, as was formerly to be seen in
  Debrett's Peerage, but though arms are matriculated to them in Lyon
  Register, this particular adornment forms no part thereof, and it has now
  disappeared from the printed Peerage books. The family of Britton have,
  however, recently recorded as a badge a double-headed eagle displayed
  ermine, holding in its claws an escutcheon of their arms (Plate
  VIII.).</p>

  <p>Occasionally batons or wands or other insignia of office are to be
  found in conjunction with armorial bearings, but these will be more fully
  dealt with under the heading of Insignia of Office. Before dealing with
  the usual supporters, one perhaps may briefly allude to "inanimate"
  supporters. <!-- Page 415 --><span class="pagenum" title="469.png"><a
  name="page415"></a>{415}</span></p>

  <p>Probably the most curious instance of all will be found in the
  achievement of the Earls of Errol as it appears in the MS. of Sir David
  Lindsay. In this two ox-yokes take the place of the supporters. The
  curious tradition which has been attached to the Hay arms is quoted as
  follows by Sir James Balfour Paul, Lyon King of Arms, in his "Heraldry in
  relation to Scottish History and Art," who writes: "Take the case of the
  well-known coat of the Hays, and hear the description of its origin as
  given by Nisbet: 'In the reign of Kenneth III., about the year 980, when
  the Danes invaded Scotland, and prevailing in the battle of Luncarty, a
  country Scotsman with his two sons, of great strength and courage, having
  rural weapons, as the yokes of their plough, and such plough furniture,
  stopped the Scots in their flight in a certain defile, and upbraiding
  them with cowardice, obliged them to rally, who with them renewed the
  battle, and gave a total overthrow to the victorious Danes; and it is
  said by some, after the victory was obtained, the old man lying on the
  ground, wounded and fatigued, cried, "Hay, Hay," which word became a
  surname to his posterity. He and his sons being nobilitate, the King gave
  him the aforesaid arms (argent, three escutcheons gules) to intimate that
  the father and the two sons had been luckily the three shields of
  Scotland, and gave them as much land in the Carse of Gowrie as a falcon
  did fly over without lighting, which having flown a great way, she
  lighted on a stone there called the Falcon Stone to this day. The
  circumstances of which story is not only perpetuated by the three
  escutcheons, but by the exterior ornaments of the achievement of the
  family of Errol; having for crest, on a wreath, a falcon proper; for
  supporters two men in country habits, holding the oxen-yokes of a plough
  over their shoulders; and for motto, "Serva jugum."'</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately for the truth of this picturesque tale there are
  several reasons which render it utterly incredible, not the least being
  that at the period of the supposed battle armorial bearings were quite
  unknown, and could not have formed the subject of a royal gift. Hill
  Burton, indeed, strongly doubts the occurrence of the battle itself, and
  says that Hector Boece, who relates the occurrence, must be under strong
  suspicion of having entirely invented it. As for the origin of the name
  itself, it is, as Mr. Cosmo Innes points out in his work on 'Scottish
  Surnames,' derived from a place in Normandy, and neither it nor any other
  surname occurred in Scotland till long after the battle of Luncarty. I
  have mentioned this story in some detail, as it is a very typical
  specimen of its class; but there are others like unto it, often traceable
  to the same incorrigible old liar, Hector Boece."</p>

  <p>It is not unlikely that the ox-yoke was a badge of the Hays, Earls of
  Errol, and a reference to the variations of the original arms, crest,
  <!-- Page 416 --><span class="pagenum" title="470.png"><a
  name="page416"></a>{416}</span>and supporters of Hay will show how the
  changes have been rung on the shields, falcon, ox-yokes, and countrymen
  of the legend.</p>

  <p>Another instance is to be found in the arms of the Mowbray family as
  they were at one time depicted with an ostrich feather on either side of
  the shield (Fig. 675, p. 465), and at first one might be inclined to
  class these amongst the inanimate supporters. The Garter plate, however,
  of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, probably supplies the key to the
  whole matter, for this shows not only the ostrich feathers but also
  supporters of the ordinary character in their usual position. From the
  last-mentioned instance, it is evident the ostrich feathers can be only
  representations of the badge, their character doubtless being peculiarly
  adaptable to the curious position they occupy. They are of course the
  same in the case of the Mowbray arms, and doubtless the ox-yoke of the
  Earl of Errol is similarly no more than a badge.</p>

  <p>A most curious instance of supporters is to be found in the case of
  the arms of Viscount Montgomery. This occurs in a record of them in
  Ulster's Office, where the arms appear without the usual kind of
  supporters, but represented with an arm in armour, on either side issuing
  from clouds in base, the hands supporting the shield.</p>

  <p>When supporters are inanimate objects, the escutcheon is said to be
  cottised&mdash;a term derived from the French word <i>côté</i> (a
  side)&mdash;in contradistinction to supported. An old Scottish term for
  supporters was "bearers."</p>

  <p>Amongst other cases where the shield is cottised by inanimate objects
  may be mentioned the following. The Breton family of "Bastard" depict
  their shield cottised by two swords, with the points in base. The
  Marquises Alberti similarly use two lighted flambeaux, and the Dalzells
  (of Binns) the extraordinary device of a pair of tent-poles. Whether this
  last has been officially sanctioned I am unaware. The "Pillars of
  Hercules" used by Charles V. are, perhaps, the best known of this group
  of supporters. In many cases (notably foreign) the supporters appear to
  have gradually receded to the back of the shield, as in the case of the
  Comte d'Erps, Chancellor of Brabant, where two maces (or) are represented
  saltirewise <i>behind</i> the shield. Generally, however, this variation
  is found in conjunction with purely official or corporate
  achievements.</p>

  <p>A curious example of inanimate supporters occurs on the English seal
  of William, Lord Botreaux (1426), where, on each side of a couché shield
  exhibiting a griffin "segreant" and surmounted by a helmet and crest, a
  buttress is quaintly introduced, in evident allusion to the owner's name.
  A somewhat similar arrangement appears on the Scottish seal of William
  Ruthven (1396), where a tree growing from a mount is placed on each side
  of the escutcheon. Another instance is to be <!-- Page 417 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="471.png"><a name="page417"></a>{417}</span>found
  in the seal of John de Segrave, where a garb is placed on either side of
  the shield. Perhaps mention should here be made of the arms (granted in
  1826) of the National Bank of Scotland, the shield of which is
  "surrounded with two thistles proper disposed in orle."</p>

  <p>Heraldic supporters as such, or badges occupying the position and
  answering the purpose of supporters, and not merely as artistic
  accessories, in England date from the early part of the fourteenth
  century. Very restricted in use at first, they later rapidly became
  popular, and there were few peers who did not display them upon their
  seals. For some reason, however, very few indeed appear on the early
  Garter plates. It is a striking fact that by far the larger number of the
  ancient standards display as the chief device not the arms but one of the
  supporters, and I am inclined to think that in this fact we have further
  confirmation of my belief that the origin of supporters is found in the
  badge.</p>

  <p>Even after the use of two supporters had become general, a third
  figure is often found placed behind the shield, and forms a connecting
  link with the old practice of filling the void spaces on seals, to which
  we have already referred. On the seal of <span class="sc">William
  Sterling</span>, in 1292, two lions rampant support the shield in front
  of a tree. The shield on the seal of <span class="sc">Oliver
  Rouillon</span>, in 1376, is supported by an angel, and by two demi-lions
  couchant-guardant in base. That of <span class="sc">Pierre Avoir</span>,
  in 1378, is held by a demi-eagle above the shield, and by two mermaids.
  On many ancient seals the supporters are disposed so that they hold the
  crested helm above a couché shield.</p>

  <p>The counter-seals of <span class="sc">Rudolf IV.</span>, Archduke of
  <span class="sc">Austria</span>, in 1359 and 1362, afford instances in
  which a second set of supporters is used to hold up the crested helm. The
  shield of <span class="sc">Austria</span> is supported by two lions, on
  whose volets are the arms of <span class="sc">Hapsburg</span> and <span
  class="sc">Pfirt</span>; the crested helm (coroneted, and having a
  panache of ostrich feathers) is also held by two lions, whose volets are
  charged with the arms of <span class="sc">Stiria</span>, and of <span
  class="sc">Carinthia</span> (<span class="sc">Hueber</span>, <i>Austria
  Illustrata,</i> tab. xviii.).</p>

  <p>In 1372 the seal of <span class="sc">Edmund Mortimer</span> represents
  his shield hanging from a rose-tree, and supported by two lions couchant
  (of <span class="sc">March</span>), whose heads are covered by coroneted
  helmets with a panache (azure) as crest.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Boutell</span> directs attention to the fact that the
  shield of <span class="sc">Edmund de Arundel</span> (1301-1326) is placed
  between similar helms and panaches, without the supporting beasts
  ("Heraldry: Historical and Popular," pp. 271-418).</p>

  <p>Crested supporters have sometimes been misunderstood, and quoted as
  instances of double supporters&mdash;for instance, by <span
  class="sc">Lower</span>, "Curiosities of Heraldry," who gives (p. 144) a
  cut from the <!-- Page 418 --><span class="pagenum" title="472.png"><a
  name="page418"></a>{418}</span>achievement of the French <span
  class="sc">D'Albrets</span> as "the most singular supporters, perhaps, in
  the whole circle of heraldry." These supporters are two lions couchant
  (or), each helmed, and crested with an eagle au vol leve. These eagles
  certainly assist in holding the shield, but the lions are its true
  supporters; nor is this arrangement by any means unique. The swans which
  were used as supporters by <span class="sc">Jean, Duc de Berri</span>, in
  1386, are each mounted upon a bear. Two wild men, each <i>à cheval</i> on
  a lion, support the escutcheons of <span class="sc">Gerard
  D'Harchies</span> (1476) and of <span class="sc">Nicole de Giresme</span>
  (1464). Two lions sejant, helmed and crested (the crest is a human head
  with the ears of an ass) were the supporters of <span class="sc">Arnaud
  D'Albrey</span> in 1368.</p>

  <p>Scotland, which is the home of curiosities of heraldry, gives us at
  least two instances of the use of supporters which must be absolutely
  unique&mdash;that is, the surcharging of an escutcheon with an
  inescutcheon, to the latter of which supporters are attached. The first
  instance occurs in the cases of Baronets of Nova Scotia, a clause
  appearing in all the earlier patents which ordained "that the Baronets,
  and their heirs-male, should, as an <i>additament of honour</i> to their
  armorial ensigns, bear, either on a canton or inescutcheon, in their
  option, the ensign of Nova Scotia, being <i>argent</i>, a cross of St.
  Andrew <i>azure</i> (the badge of Scotland counterchanged), charged with
  an inescutcheon of the Royal Arms of Scotland, supported on the dexter by
  the Royal unicorn, and on the sinister by a savage, or wild man, proper;
  and for crest, a branch of laurel and a thistle issuing from two hands
  conjoined, the one being armed, the other naked; with the motto, "Munit
  hæc et altera vincit." The incongruity of these exterior ornaments within
  a shield of arms is noticed by Nisbet, who informs us, however, that they
  are very soon removed. In the year 1629, after Nova Scotia was sold to
  the French, the Baronets of Scotland, and their heirs-male, were
  authorised by Charles I. "to wear and carry about their necks, in all
  time coming, an orange-tawny silk ribbon, whereon shall be pendent, in a
  scutcheon <i>argent</i>, a saltire <i>azure</i>, thereon an inescutcheon,
  of the arms of Scotland, with an Imperial crown above the scutcheon and
  encircled with this motto: 'Fax mentis honestæ gloria.'" According to the
  same authority, this badge was never much used "about their necks," but
  was carried, by way of canton or inescutcheon, on their armorial
  bearings, without the motto, and, of course, since then the superimposed
  supporters have been dropped.</p>

  <p>The same peculiarity of supporters being surcharged upon a shield will
  be found, however, in the matriculation (1795) to Cumming-Gordon of
  Altyre. These arms are depicted on Plate III. In this the entire
  achievement (arms, crest, motto, and supporters) of Gordon of Gordon <!--
  Page 419 --><span class="pagenum" title="473.png"><a
  name="page419"></a>{419}</span>is placed upon an inescutcheon
  superimposed over the arms of Cumming.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the arms, and the arms only, constitute the mark of a
  given family, and whilst due difference is made in the respective
  shields, no attempt is made as regards crest or supporters to impose any
  distinction between the figures granted to different families even where
  no blood relationship exists. The result is that whilst the same crests
  and supporters are duplicated over and over again, they at any rate
  remain in Scotland simple, graceful, and truly heraldic, even when judged
  by the most rigid mediæval standard. They are, of course, necessarily of
  no value whatever for identification. In England the simplicity is
  relinquished for the sake of distinction, and it is held that equivalent
  differentiation must be made, both in regard to the crests and the
  supporters, as is made between the shields of different families. The
  result as to modern crests is truly appalling, and with supporters it is
  almost equally so, for by their very nature it is impossible to design
  adequate differences for crests and supporters, as can readily be done in
  the charges upon a shield, without creating monstrosities. With regret
  one has to admit that the dangling shields, the diapered chintz-like
  bodies, and the fasces and other footstools so frequently provided for
  modern supporters in England would seem to be pedantic, unnecessary, and
  inartistic strivings after a useless ideal.</p>

  <p>In England the right to bear supporters is confined to those to whom
  they have been granted or recorded, but such grant or record is very
  rigidly confined to peers, to Knights of the Garter, Thistle, and St.
  Patrick, and to Knights Grand Cross, or Knights Grand Commanders (as the
  case may be) of other Orders. Before the Order of the Bath was divided
  into classes, Knights of the Bath had supporters. As by an unwritten but
  nowadays invariably accepted law, the Orders of the Garter, Thistle, and
  St. Patrick are confined to members of the peerage, those entitled to
  claim (upon their petitioning) a grant of supporters in England are in
  practice limited to peers and Knights Grand Cross or Knights Grand
  Commanders. In the cases of peers, the grant is always attached to a
  particular peerage, the "remainder" in the limitations of the grant being
  to "those of his descendants upon whom the peerage may devolve," or some
  other words to this effect. In the cases of life peers and Knights Grand
  Cross the grant has no hereditary limitation, and the right to the
  supporters is personal to the grantee. There is nothing to distinguish
  the supporters of a peer from those of a Knight Grand Cross. Baronets of
  England, Ireland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom as such are not
  entitled to claim grants of supporters, but there are some number of
  cases in which, by special favour of the sovereign, specific Royal
  Warrants have been <!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum" title="474.png"
  ><a name="page420"></a>{420}</span>issued-either as marks of favour or as
  augmentations of honour&mdash;conveying the pleasure of the sovereign to
  the kings of arms, and directing the latter to grant supporters&mdash;to
  descend with the baronetcy. Of the cases of this nature the following may
  be quoted: Guise (Royal Warrant, dated July 12, 1863), Prevost (Royal
  Warrant, October 1816), Guinness, now Lord Ardilaun (Royal Warrant, dated
  April 15, 1867), Halford (Royal Warrant, May 19, 1827), Otway (Royal
  Warrant, June 10, 1845), and Laking. These, of course, are exceptional
  marks of favour from the sovereign, and this favour in at least two
  instances has been extended to untitled families. In 1815 Mr. George
  Watson-Taylor, an especial intimate of the then Prince Regent, by Royal
  Warrant dated September 28, 1815, was granted the following supporters:
  "On either side a leopard proper, armed and langued gules, collared and
  chained or." A more recent instance, and, with the exception of an Irish
  case presently to be referred to, the only other one within the knowledge
  of the writer, is the case of the Speke<a name="NtA_25"
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> arms. It is recited in the Royal
  Warrant, dated July 26, 1867, that Captain John Hanning Speke "was by a
  deplorable accident suddenly deprived of his life before he had received
  any mark of our Royal favour" in connection with the discovery of the
  sources of the Nile. The Warrant goes on to recite the grant to his
  father, William Speke, of Jordans, co. Somerset, of the following
  augmentations to his original arms (argent, two bars azure) namely: on a
  chief a representation of flowing water superinscribed with the word
  "Nile," and for a crest of honourable augmentation a "crocodile," also
  the supporters following&mdash;that is to say, on the dexter side a
  crocodile, and on the sinister side a hippopotamus. Some number of
  English baronets have gone to the trouble and expense of obtaining grants
  of supporters in Lyon Office; for example Sir Christopher Baynes, by
  grant dated June 10, 1805, obtained two savages, wreathed about the
  temples and loins, each holding a club over the exterior shoulder. It is
  very doubtful to what extent such grants in Scotland to domiciled
  Englishmen can be upheld. Many other baronets have at one time or another
  assumed supporters without any official warrant or authority in
  consequence of certain action taken by an earlier committee of the
  baronetage, but cases of this kind are slowly dropping out of the Peerage
  books, and this, <!-- Page 421 --><span class="pagenum" title="475.png"
  ><a name="page421"></a>{421}</span>combined with the less ostentatious
  taste of the present day in the depicting of armorial bearings upon
  carriages and elsewhere, is slowly but steadily reducing the use of
  supporters to those who possess official authority for their display.</p>

  <p>Another fruitful origin of the use of unauthorised supporters at the
  present day lies in the fact that grants of supporters personal to the
  grantee for his life only have been made to Knights Grand Cross or to
  life peers in cases where a hereditary title has been subsequently
  conferred. The limitations of the grant of supporters having never been
  extended, the grant has naturally expired with the death of the life
  honour to which the supporters were attached.</p>

  <p>In addition to these cases there is a very limited number of families
  which have always claimed supporters by prescriptive right, amongst whom
  may be mentioned Tichborne of Tichborne (two lions guardant gules), De
  Hoghton of Hoghton (two bulls argent), Scroope of Danby (two choughs),
  and Stapylton. Concerning such cases it can only be said that in England
  no official sanction has ever been given to such use, and no case exists
  of any official recognition of the right of an untitled family to bear
  supporters to their arms save those few exceptional cases governed by
  specific Royal Warrants. In many cases, notably Scroope, Luttrel, Hilton,
  and Stapylton, the supporters have probably originated in their
  legitimate adoption at an early period in connection with peerage or
  other titular distinction, and have continued inadvertently in use when
  the titular distinctions to which they belonged have ceased to exist or
  have devolved upon other families. Possibly their use in some cases has
  been the result of a <i>claim</i> to <i>de jure</i> honours. The cases
  where supporters are claimed "by prescriptive right" are few indeed in
  England, and need not be further considered.</p>

  <p>Whilst the official laws in Ireland are, and have apparently always
  been, the same as in England, there is no doubt that the heads of the
  different septs assert a claim to the right to use supporters. On this
  point Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster King of Arms, wrote: "No registry of
  supporters to an Irish chieftain appears in Ulster's Office, in right of
  his chieftaincy only, and without the honour of peerage, nor does any
  authority to bear them exist." But nevertheless "The O'Donovan" uses,
  dexter, a lion guardant, and sinister, a griffin; "The O'Gorman" uses,
  dexter, a lion, and sinister, a horse; "The O'Reilly" uses two lions or.
  "The O'Connor Don," however, is in the unique position of bearing
  supporters by unquestionable right, inasmuch as the late Queen Victoria,
  on the occasion of her last visit to Dublin, issued her Royal Warrant
  conferring the right upon him. The supporters granted to him were "two
  lions rampant gules, each gorged with an antique crown, and charged on
  the shoulder with an Irish harp or." <!-- Page 422 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="476.png"><a name="page422"></a>{422}</span></p>

  <p>The right to bear supporters in Scotland is on a widely different
  basis from that in any other country. As in England and Ireland, peers
  and Knights Grand Cross are permitted to obtain grants of these
  distinctions. But outside and beyond these there are many other families
  who bear them by right. At the official inquiry concerning the Lyon
  Office, the Lyon-Depute, Mr. George Tait, put in a Note of Persons whom
  he considered might lawfully bear supporters under Scottish Heraldic Law.
  The following is the text of the note in question:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Note of Persons</span> who are considered by <span
  class="sc">George Tait</span>, Esq., Lyon-Depute, to be entitled to
  supporters, furnished to the Commissioners of Inquiry by their desire,
  intimated to him at his examination this day, June 27, 1821.</p>

  <p>"1. <i>Peers.</i>&mdash;By immemorial usage, Peers have right to
  supporters, and supporters are commonly inserted in modern patents of
  Peerage. This includes Peeresses in their own right.</p>

  <p>"2. <i>Ancient Usage.</i>&mdash;Those private gentlemen, and the
  lawful heirs-male of their bodies, who can prove immemorial usage of
  carrying supporters, or a usage very ancient, and long prior to the Act
  1672, are entitled to have their supporters recognised, it being presumed
  that they received them from lawful authority, on account of feats of
  valour in battle or in tournament, or as marks of the Royal favour (see
  <i>Murray of Touchadam's Case</i>, June 24, 1778).</p>

  <p>"3. <i>Barons.</i>&mdash;Lawful heirs-male of the bodies of the
  smaller Barons, who had the full right of free barony (not mere
  freeholders) prior to 1587, when representation of the minor Barons was
  fully established, upon the ground that those persons were Barons, and
  sat in Parliament as such, and were of the same as the titled Barons.
  Their right is recognised by the writers on heraldry and antiquities.
  Persons having right on this ground, will almost always have established
  it by ancient usage, and the want of usage is a strong presumption
  against the right.</p>

  <p>"4. <i>Chiefs.</i>&mdash;Lawful heirs-male of Chiefs of tribes or
  clans which had attained power, and extensive territories and numerous
  members at a distant period, or at least of tribes consisting of numerous
  families of some degree of rank and consideration. Such persons will in
  general have right to supporters, either as Barons (great or small) or by
  ancient usage. When any new claim is set up on such a ground, it may be
  viewed with suspicion, and it will be extremely difficult to establish
  it, chiefly from the present state of society, by which the traces of
  clanship, or the patriarchal state, are in most parts of the country
  almost obliterated; and indeed it is very difficult to conceive a case
  <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum" title="477.png"><a
  name="page423"></a>{423}</span>in which a new claim of that kind could be
  admitted. Mr. Tait has had some such claims, and has rejected them.</p>

  <p>"5. <i>Royal Commissions.</i>&mdash;Knights of the Garter and Bath,
  and any others to whom the King may think proper to concede the honour of
  supporters.</p>

  <p>"These are the only descriptions of persons who appear to Mr. Tait to
  be entitled to supporters.</p>

  <p>"An idea has gone abroad, that Scots Baronets are entitled to
  supporters; but there is no authority for this in their patents, or any
  good authority for it elsewhere. And for many years subsequent to 1672, a
  very small portion indeed of their arms which are matriculated in the
  Lyon Register, are matriculated with supporters; so small as necessarily
  to lead to this inference, that those whose arms are entered with
  supporters had right to them on other grounds, <i>e.g.</i> ancient usage,
  chieftainship, or being heirs of Barons. The arms of few Scots Baronets
  are matriculated during the last fifty or sixty years; but the practice
  of assigning supporters gradually gained ground during that time, or
  rather the practice of assigning supporters to them, merely as such,
  seems to have arisen during that period; and it appears to Mr. Tait to be
  an erroneous practice, which he would not be warranted in following.</p>

  <p>"British Baronets have also, by recent practice, had supporters
  assigned to them, but Mr. Tait considers the practice to be unwarranted;
  and accordingly, in a recent case, a gentleman, upon being created a
  Baronet, applied for supporters to the King&mdash;having applied to Mr.
  Tait, and been informed by him that he did not conceive the Lord Lyon
  entitled to give supporters to British Baronets.</p>

  <p>"No females (except Peeresses in their own right) are entitled to
  supporters, as the representation of families is only in the male line.
  But the widows of Peers, by courtesy, carry their arms and supporters;
  and the sons of Peers, using the lower titles of the peerage by courtesy,
  also carry the supporters by courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tait does not know of any authority for the Lord Lyon having a
  discretionary power of granting supporters, and understands that only the
  King has such a power.</p>

  <p>"Humbly submitted by</p>

  <p class="author">(Signed)<span class="gap" style="width:6em;"></span>"<span class="sc">G. Tait</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Though this statement would give a good general idea of the Scottish
  practice, its publication entails the addition of certain qualifying
  remarks. Supporters are most certainly not "commonly inserted in modern
  patents of peerage." Supporters appertaining to peerages are granted by
  special and separate patents. These to English subjects <!-- Page 424
  --><span class="pagenum" title="478.png"><a
  name="page424"></a>{424}</span>are now under the hand and seal of Garter
  alone. In the event of a grant following upon the creation of an Irish
  peerage, the patent of supporters would be issued by Ulster King of Arms.
  But it is competent to Lyon King of Arms to matriculate the arms of
  Scottish peers with supporters, or to grant these to such as may still be
  without them. Both Lyon and Ulster would appear to have the right to
  grant supporters to Peers of the United Kingdom who are heraldically
  their domiciled subjects. With regard to the second paragraph of Mr.
  Tait's memorandum, there will be few families within its range who will
  not be included within the range of the paragraph which follows, and the
  presumption would rather be that the use of supporters by an untitled
  family originated in the right of barony than in any mythical grant
  following upon mythical feats of valour.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tait, however, is clearly wrong in his statement that "no females
  (except peeresses in their own right) are entitled to supporters." They
  have constantly been allowed to the heir of line, and their devolution
  through female heirs must of necessity presuppose the right thereto of
  the female heir through whom the inheritance is claimed. A recent case in
  point occurs with regard to the arms of Hunter-Weston, matriculated in
  1880, Mrs. Hunter-Weston being the heir of line of Hunter of Hunterston.
  Widows of peers, providing they have arms of their own to impale with
  those of their husbands, cannot be said to only bear the supporters of
  their deceased husbands by courtesy. With them it is a matter of right.
  The eldest sons of peers bearing courtesy titles most certainly do not
  bear the supporters of the peerage to which they are heirs. Even the far
  more generally accepted "courtesy" practice of bearing coronets is
  expressly forbidden by an Earl-Marshal's Warrant.</p>

  <p>Consequently it may be asserted that the laws concerning the use of
  supporters in Scotland are as follows: In the first place, no supporters
  can be borne of right unless they have been the subject of formal grant
  or matriculation. The following classes are entitled to obtain, upon
  payment of the necessary fees, the grant or matriculation of supporters
  to themselves, or to themselves and their descendants according as the
  case may be: (1) Peers of Scotland, and other peers who are domiciled
  Scotsmen. (2) Knights of the Garter, Knights of the Thistle, and Knights
  of St. Patrick, being Scotsmen, are entitled as such to obtain grants of
  supporters to themselves for use during life, but as these three orders
  are now confined to members of the peerage, the supporters used would be
  probably those appertaining to their peerages, and it is unlikely that
  any further grants for life will be made under these circumstances. (3)
  Knights of the Bath until the revision of the order were entitled to
  obtain grants of supporters to themselves for <!-- Page 425 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="479.png"><a name="page425"></a>{425}</span>use
  during their lifetimes, and there are many instances in the Lyon Register
  where such grants have been made. (4) Knights Grand Cross of the Bath, of
  St. Michael and St. George, and of the Royal Victorian Order, and Knights
  Grand Commanders of the Orders of the Star of India, and of the Indian
  Empire, are entitled to obtain grants of supporters for use during their
  lifetimes. (5) The lawful heirs of the minor barons who had the full
  right of free barony prior to 1587 may matriculate supporters if they can
  show their ancestors used them, or may now obtain grants. Though
  practically the whole of these have been at some time or other
  matriculated in Lyon Register, there still remain a few whose claims have
  never been officially adjudicated upon. For example, it is only quite
  recently that the ancient Swinton supporters have been formally enrolled
  on the official records (Plate IV.). (6) There are certain others, being
  chiefs of clans and the heirs of those to whom grants have been made in
  times past, who also have the right, but as no new claim is likely to be
  so recognised in the future, it may be taken that these are confined to
  those cases which have been already entered in the Lyon Register.</p>

  <p>During the latter part of the eighteenth century, the executive of
  Lyon Office had fallen into great disrepute. The office of Lyon King of
  Arms had been granted to the Earls of Kinnoul, who had contented
  themselves with appointing deputies and drawing fees. The whole subject
  of armorial jurisdiction in Scotland had become lax to the last degree,
  and very many irregularities had crept in. One, and probably the worst
  result, had been the granting of supporters in many cases where no valid
  reason other than the payment of fees could be put forward to warrant the
  obtaining of such a privilege. And the result was the growth and
  acceptance of the fixed idea that it was within the power of Lyon King of
  Arms to grant supporters to any one whom he might choose to so favour.
  Consequently many grants of supporters were placed upon the records, and
  many untitled families of Scotland apparently have the right under these
  patents of grant to add supporters to their arms. Though it is an
  arguable matter whether the Lord Lyon was justified in making these
  grants, there can be no doubt that, so long as they remain upon the
  official register, and no official steps are taken to cancel the patents,
  they must be accepted as existing by legal right. Probably the most
  egregious instance of such a grant is to be found in the case of the
  grant to the first baronet of the family of Antrobus, who on purchasing
  the estate of Rutherford, the seat of the extinct Lords Rutherford,
  obtained from the then Lyon King of Arms a grant of the peerage
  supporters carried by the previous owners of the property.</p>

  <p>With regard to the devolution of Scottish supporters, the large <!--
  Page 426 --><span class="pagenum" title="480.png"><a
  name="page426"></a>{426}</span>proportion of those registered in Lyon
  Office are recorded in the terms of some patent which specifies the
  limitations of their descent, so that there are a comparatively small
  number only concerning which there can be any uncertainty as to whom the
  supporters will descend to. The difficulty can only arise in those cases
  in which the arms are matriculated with supporters as borne by ancient
  usage in the early years of the Lyon Register, or in the cases of
  supporters still to be matriculated on the same grounds by those families
  who have so far failed to comply with the Act of 1672. Whilst Mr. Tait,
  in his memorandum which has been previously quoted, would deny the right
  of inheritance to female heirs, there is no doubt whatever that in many
  cases such heirs have been allowed to succeed to the supporters of their
  families. Taking supporters as an appanage of right of barony (either
  greater or lesser), there can be no doubt that the greater baronies, and
  consequently the supporters attached to them, devolved upon heirs female,
  and upon the heir of line inheriting through a female ancestor; and,
  presumably, the same considerations must of necessity hold good with
  regard to those supporters which are borne by right of lesser barony, for
  the greater and the lesser were the same thing, differing only in degree,
  until in the year 1587 the lesser barons were relieved of compulsory
  attendance in Parliament. At the same time there can be no doubt that the
  headship of a family must rest with the heir male, and consequently it
  would seem that in those cases in which the supporters are borne by right
  of being head of a clan or chief of a name, the right of inheritance
  would devolve upon the heir male. There must of necessity be some cases
  in which it is impossible to determine whether the supporters were
  originally called into being by right of barony or because of
  chieftainship, and the consequence has been that concerning the descent
  of the supporters of the older untitled families there has been no
  uniformity in the practice of Lyon Office, and it is impossible from the
  precedents which exist to deduce any certain and unalterable rule upon
  the point. Precedents exist in each case, and the well-known case of
  Smith-Cunningham and Dick-Cunningham, which is often referred to as
  settling the point, did nothing of the kind, inasmuch as that judgment
  depended upon the interpretation of a specific Act of Parliament, and was
  not the determination of a point of heraldic law. The case, however,
  afforded the opportunity to Lord Jeffrey to make the following remarks
  upon the point (see p. 355, Seton):&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If I may be permitted to take a common-sense view, I should say that
  there is neither an inflexible rule nor a uniform practice in the matter.
  There may be cases where the heir of line will exclude the heir male, and
  there may be cases where the converse will be held. In <!-- Page 427
  --><span class="pagenum" title="481.png"><a
  name="page427"></a>{427}</span>my opinion the common-sense rule is that
  the chief armorial dignities should follow the more substantial rights
  and dignities of the family. <i>If the heir male succeed to the title and
  estates, I think it reasonable that he should also succeed to the
  armorial bearings of the head of the house.</i> I would think it a very
  difficult proposition to establish that the heir of line, when denuded of
  everything else, was still entitled to retain the barren honours of
  heraldry. But I give no opinion upon that point."</p>

  <p>Mr. Seton, in his "Law and Practice of Heraldry in Scotland," sums up
  the matter of inheritance in these words (see p. 357): "As already
  indicated, however, by one of the learned Lords in his opinion on the
  case of Cuninghame, the practice in the matter in question has been far
  from uniform; and accordingly we are very much disposed to go along with
  his relative suggestion, that 'the chief armorial dignities should follow
  the more substantial rights and dignities of the family'; and that when
  the latter are enjoyed by the female heir of line, such heir should also
  be regarded as fairly entitled to claim the principal heraldic
  honours."</p>

  <p>The result has been in practice that the supporters of a family have
  usually been matriculated to whoever has carried on the name and line of
  the house, unless the supporters in question have been governed by a
  specific grant, the limitations of which exist to be referred to, but in
  cases where both the heir of line and the heir male have been left in a
  prominent position, the difficulty of decision has in many cases been got
  over by allowing supporters to both of them. The most curious instance of
  this within our knowledge occurs with regard to the family of
  Chisholm.</p>

  <p>Chisholm of Erchless Castle appears undoubtedly to have succeeded as
  head and chief of his name&mdash;"The Chisholm"&mdash;about the end of
  the seventeenth century. As such supporters were carried, namely: "On
  either side a savage wreathed about the head and middle with laurel, and
  holding a club over his exterior shoulder."</p>

  <p>At the death of Alexander Chisholm&mdash;"The Chisholm"&mdash;7th
  February 1793, the chieftainship and the estates passed to his
  half-brother William, but his heir of line was his only child Mary, who
  married James Gooden of London. Mrs. Mary Chisholm or Gooden in 1827
  matriculated the <i>undifferenced</i> arms of Chisholm ["Gules, a boar's
  head couped or"], without supporters, but in 1831 the heir male
  <i>also</i> matriculated the same <i>undifferenced</i> arms, in this case
  with supporters.</p>

  <p>The chieftainship of the Chisholm family then continued with the male
  line until the death of Duncan Macdonell Chisholm&mdash;"The
  Chisholm"&mdash;in 1859, when his only sister and heir became heir of
  line of the later chiefs. She was then Jemima Batten, and by Royal <!--
  Page 428 --><span class="pagenum" title="482.png"><a
  name="page428"></a>{428}</span>Licence in that year she and her husband
  assumed the additional surname of Chisholm, becoming Chisholm-Batten,
  and, contrary to the English practice in such cases, the arms of Chisholm
  <i>alone</i> were matriculated in 1860 to Mrs. Chisholm-Batten and her
  descendants. These once again were the <i>undifferenced</i> coat of
  Chisholm, viz.: "Gules, a boar's head couped or." Arms for Batten have
  since been granted in England, the domicile of the family being English,
  and the arms of the present Mr. Chisholm-Batten, though including the
  quartering for Chisholm, is usually marshalled as allowed in the College
  of Arms by English rules.</p>

  <p>Though there does not appear to have been any subsequent
  rematriculation in favour of the heir male who succeeded as "The
  Chisholm," the undifferenced arms were also considered to have devolved
  upon him together with the supporters. On the death of the last known
  male heir of the family, Roderick Donald Matheson Chisholm, The Chisholm,
  in 1887, Mr. James Chisholm Gooden-Chisholm claimed the chieftainship as
  heir of line, and in that year the Gooden-Chisholm arms were again
  rematriculated. In this case supporters were added to the again
  undifferenced arms of Chisholm, but a slight alteration in the supporters
  was made, the clubs being reversed and placed to rest on the ground.</p>

  <p>Amongst the many other untitled Scottish families who rightly bear
  supporters, may be mentioned Gibsone of Pentland, Barclay of Urie,
  Barclay of Towie, Drummond of Megginch, Maclachlan of that Ilk, "Cluny"
  Macpherson, Cunninghame, and Brisbane of that Ilk.</p>

  <p>Armorial matters in the Channel Islands present a very unsatisfactory
  state of affairs. There never appears to have been any Visitation, and
  the arms of Channel Island families which officially pass muster must be
  confined to those of the very few families (for example, De Carteret,
  Dobrée, and Tupper) who have found it necessary or advisable on their own
  initiative to register their arms in the official English sources. In
  none of these instances have supporters been allowed, nor I believe did
  any of these families claim to use them, but some (Lemprière, De
  Saumerez, and other families) assert the possession of such a distinction
  by prescriptive right. If the right to supporters be a privilege of
  peerage, or if, as in Scotland, it anciently depended upon the right of
  free barony, the position of these Channel Island families in former days
  as seignorial lords was much akin. But it is highly improbable that the
  right to bear supporters in such cases will ever be officially
  recognised, and the case of De Saumerez, in which the supporters were
  bedevilled and regranted to descend with the peerage, will probably
  operate as a decisive precedent upon the point and against such a right.
  There are some number of families <!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum" title="483.png"
  ><a name="page429"></a>{429}</span>of foreign origin who bear supporters
  or claim them by the assertion of foreign right. Where this right can be
  established their use has been confirmed by Royal Licence in this country
  in some number of cases; for example, the cases of Rothschild and De
  Salis. In other cases (for example, the case of Chamier) no official
  record of the supporters exists with the record of the arms, and
  presumably the foreign right to the supporters could not have been
  established at the time of registration.</p>

  <p>With regard to impersonal arms, the right to supporters in England is
  not easy to define. In the case of counties, crests and supporters are
  granted if the county likes to pay for them.</p>

  <p>In the case of towns, the rule in England is that an ordinary town may
  not have supporters but that a city may, and instances are numerous where
  supporters have been granted upon the elevation of a town to the dignity
  of a city. Birmingham, Sheffield, and Nottingham are all recent instances
  in point. This rule, however, is not absolutely rigid, and an exception
  may be pointed to in the case of Liverpool, the supporters being granted
  in 1797, and the town not being created a city until a subsequent date.
  In Scotland, where, of course, until quite recently supporters were
  granted practically to anybody who chose to pay for them, a grant will be
  found for the county of Perth dated in 1800, in which supporters were
  included. But as to towns and cities it is no more than a matter of fees,
  any town in Scotland eligible for arms being at liberty to obtain
  supporters also if they are desired. In grants of arms to corporate
  bodies it is difficult to draw the line or to deduce any actual rule. In
  23rd of Henry VIII. the Grocers' Livery Company were granted "two
  griffins per fess gules and or," and many other of the Livery Companies
  have supporters to their arms. Others, for no apparent reason, are
  without them. The "Merchant Adventurers' Company or Hamburg Merchants"
  have supporters, as had both the old and the new East India Companies.
  The arms of Jamaica and Cape Colony and of the British North Borneo
  Company have supporters, but on the other hand no supporters were
  assigned to Canada or to any of its provinces. In Ireland the matter
  appears to be much upon the same footing as in England, and as far as
  impersonal arms are concerned it is very difficult to say what the exact
  rule is, if this is to be deduced from known cases and past
  precedents.</p>

  <p>Probably the freedom&mdash;amounting in many cases to great
  laxity&mdash;with which in English heraldic art the positions and
  attitudes of supporters are changed, is the one point in which English
  heraldic art has entirely ignored the trammels of conventionalised
  officialism. There must be in this country scores of entrance gates where
  each <!-- Page 430 --><span class="pagenum" title="484.png"><a
  name="page430"></a>{430}</span>pillar of the gateway is surmounted by a
  shield held in the paws of a single supporter, and the Governmental use
  of the Royal supporters in an amazing variety of attitudes, some of which
  are grossly unheraldic, has not helped towards a true understanding. The
  reposeful attitude of watchful slumber in which the Royal lion and
  unicorn are so often depicted, may perhaps be in the nature of submission
  to the Biblical teaching of Isaiah that the lion shall lie down with the
  lamb (and possibly therefore also with the unicorn), in these times of
  peace which have succeeded those earlier days when "the lion beat the
  unicorn round and round the town."</p>

    argent. Crest: a dexter hand raised in benediction. Supporters: on
    either side a squirrel sejant proper.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In official minds, however, the sole attitude for the supporters is
  the rampant, or as near an approach to it as the nature of the animal
  will allow. A human being, a bird, or a fish naturally can hardly adopt
  the attitude. In Scotland, the land of heraldic freedom, various
  exceptions to this can be found. Of these one can call to mind the arms
  used by the town of Kilmarnock (Fig. 668), in which the supporters,
  "squirrels proper," are depicted always as sejant. These particular
  creatures, however, would look strange to us in any other form. These
  arms unfortunately have never been matriculated as the arms of the town
  (being really the arms of the Boyd family, the attainted Earls of
  Kilmarnock), and consequently can hardly as yet be referred to as a
  definite precedent, because official matriculation might result in a
  similar "happening" to the change which was made in the case of the arms
  of Inverness. In all representations of the arms of earlier date than the
  matriculation, the supporters, (dexter) <!-- Page 431 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="485.png"><a name="page431"></a>{431}</span>a camel
  and (sinister) an elephant, are depicted <i>statant</i> on either side of
  the shield, no actual contact being made between the escutcheon and the
  supporters. But in 1900, when in a belated compliance with the Act of
  1672 the armorial bearings of the Royal Burgh of Inverness were
  matriculated, the position was altered to that more usually employed for
  supporters.</p>

  <p>The supporters always used by Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell of
  Pollok are two lions sejant guardant. These, as appears from an old seal,
  were in use as far back as the commencement of the fifteenth century, but
  the supporters officially recorded for the family are two apes. In
  English armory one or two exceptional cases may be noticed; for example,
  the supporters of the city of Bristol, which are: "On either side, on a
  mount vert, a unicorn sejant or, armed, maned, and unguled sable."
  Another instance will be found in the supporters of Lord Rosmead, which
  are: "On the dexter side an ostrich and on the sinister side a kangaroo,
  both regardant proper." From the nature of the animal, the kangaroo is
  depicted sejant.</p>

  <p>Supporters in Germany date from the same period as with ourselves,
  being to be met with on seals as far back as 1276. At first they were
  similarly purely artistic adjuncts, but they have retained much of this
  character and much of the purely permissive nature in Germany to the
  present day. It was not until about the middle of the seventeenth century
  that supporters were granted or became hereditary in that country. Grants
  of supporters can be found in England at an earlier date, but such grants
  were isolated in number. Nevertheless supporters had become hereditary
  very soon after they obtained a regularly heraldic (as opposed to a
  decorative) footing. Their use, however, was governed at that period by a
  greater freedom as to alteration and change than was customary with
  armory in general. Supporters were an adjunct of the peerage, and peers
  were not subject to the Visitations. With his freedom from arrest, his
  high social position, and his many other privileges of peerage, a peer
  was "too big" a person formerly to accept the dictatorial armorial
  control which the Crown enforced upon lesser people. Short of treason, a
  peer in any part of Great Britain for most practical purposes of social
  life was above the ordinary law. In actual fact it was only the rights of
  one peer as opposed to the rights of another peer that kept a Lord of
  Parliament under any semblance of control. When the great lords of past
  centuries could and did raise armies to fight the King a peer was hardly
  likely to, nor did he, brook much interference.</p>

  <p>Of the development of supporters in Germany Ströhl writes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Only very late, about the middle of the seventeenth century, were
  supporters granted as hereditary, but they appear in the arms of <!--
  Page 432 --><span class="pagenum" title="486.png"><a
  name="page432"></a>{432}</span>burghers in the first half of the
  fifteenth century, and the arms of many towns also possess them as
  decorative adjuncts.</p>

  <p>"The first supporters were human figures, generally portraits of the
  arms-bearers themselves; then women, young men, and boys, so-called
  <i>Schildbuben</i>. In the second half of the fourteenth century animals
  appear: lions, bears, stags, dogs, griffins, &amp;c. In the fifteenth
  century one frequently encounters angels with richly curling hair, saints
  (patrons of the bearer or of the town), then later, nude wild men and
  women (<i>Waldmenschen</i>) thickly covered with hair, with garlands
  round their loins and on their heads. The thick, hairy covering of the
  body in the case of women is only to be met with in the very beginning.
  Later the endeavour was to approach the feminine ideal as nearly as
  possible, and only the garlands were retained to point out the origin and
  the home of these figures.</p>

  <p>"At the end of the fifteenth and in the sixteenth century, there came
  into fashion lansquenets, huntsmen, pretty women and girls, both clothed
  and unclothed." Speaking of the present day, and from the executive
  standpoint, he adds:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Supporters, with the exception of flying angels, should have a
  footing on which they can stand in a natural manner, whether it be grass,
  a pedestal, a tree, or line of ornament, and to place them upon a ribbon
  of a motto is less suitable because a thin ribbon can hardly give the
  impression of a sufficiently strong support for the invariably
  heavy-looking figures of the men or animals. The supporters of the shield
  may at the same time be employed as bearers of the helmets. They bear the
  helmets either over the head or hold them in their hands. Figures
  standing near the shield, but not holding or supporting it in any way,
  cannot in the strict sense of the word be designated supporters; such
  figures are called <i>Schildwächter</i> (shield-watchers or
  guardians)."</p>

<h5>HUMAN FIGURES AS SUPPORTERS</h5>

  <p>Of all figures employed as supporters probably human beings are of
  most frequent occurrence, even when those single and double figures
  referred to on an earlier page, which are not a real part of the heraldic
  achievement, are excluded from consideration. The endless variety of
  different figures perhaps gives some clue to the reason of their frequent
  occurrence.</p>

  <p>Though the nude human figure appears (male) upon the shield of Dalziel
  and (female) in the crest of Ellis (Agar-Ellis, formerly Viscount
  Clifden), one cannot call to mind any instance of such an occurrence in
  the form of supporters, though possibly the supporters of the <!-- Page
  433 --><span class="pagenum" title="489.png"><a
  name="page433"></a>{433}</span>Glaziers' Livery Company ["Two naked boys
  proper, each holding a long torch inflamed of the last"] and of the
  Joiners' Livery Company ["Two naked boys proper, the dexter holding in
  his hand an emblematical female figure, crowned with a mural coronet
  sable, the sinister holding in his hand a square"] might be classed in
  such a character. Nude figures in armory are practically always termed
  "savages," or occasionally "woodmen" or "wildmen," and garlanded about
  the loins with foliage.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:61%;">

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig. 669.</span>&mdash;Arms
    of Arbroath: Gules, a portcullis with chains pendent or. Motto:
    "Propter Libertatem." Supporters: dexter, St. Thomas à Becket in his
    archiepiscopal robes all proper; sinister, a Baron of Scotland armed
    cap-à-pie, holding in his exterior hand the letter from the Convention
    of the Scottish Estates, held at Arbroath in the year of 1320,
    addressed to Pope John XXII., all proper.</p>
  </div>

  <p>With various adjuncts&mdash;clubs, banners, trees, branches,
  &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Savages</i> will be found as the supporters of the arms
  of the German Emperor, and in the sovereign arms of Brunswick, Denmark,
  Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, and Rudolstadt, as well as in the arms of the
  kingdom of Prussia. They also appear in the arms of the kingdom of
  Greece, though in this case they should perhaps be more properly
  described as figures of Hercules.</p>

  <p>In British armory&mdash;amongst many other families&mdash;two savages
  are the supporters of the Marquess of Ailesbury, Lord Calthorpe, Viscount
  de Vesci, Lord Elphinstone, the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, the Duke of
  Fife, Earl Fitzwilliam (each holding in the exterior hand a tree
  eradicated), Lord Kinnaird, the Earl of Morton; and amongst the baronets
  who possess supporters, Menzies, Douglas of Carr, and Williams-Drummond
  have on either side of their escutcheons a "savage." Earl Poulett alone
  has both man and woman, his supporters being: "Dexter, a savage man;
  sinister, a savage woman, both wreathed with oak, all proper." As some
  one remarked on seeing a realistic representation of this coat of arms by
  Catton, R.A., the blazon might more appropriately have concluded "all
  improper."</p>

  <p>Next after savages, the most favourite variety of the human being
  adopted as a supporter is the <i>Man in Armour</i>.</p>

  <p>Even as heraldic and heritable supporters angels are not uncommon, and
  are to be met with amongst other cases in the arms of the Marquess of
  Waterford, the Earl of Dudley, and Viscount Dillon.</p>

  <p>It is rare to find supporters definitely stated to represent any
  specific person, but in the case of the arms of Arbroath (Fig. 669) the
  supporters are "Dexter: 'St. Thomas à Becket,' and sinister, a Baron of
  Scotland." Another instance, again from Scotland, appears in a most
  extraordinary grant by the Lyon in 1816 to Sir Jonathan Wathen Waller,
  Bart., of Braywick Lodge, co. Berks, and of Twickenham, co. Middlesex. In
  this case the supporters were two elaborately "harnessed" ancient
  warriors, "to commemorate the surrender of Charles, Duke of Orleans, at
  the memorable battle of Agincourt (that word being the motto over the
  crest) in the year 1415, to Richard Waller of Groombridge in Kent, Esq.,
  from which Richard the said <!-- Page 434 --><span class="pagenum" title="490.png"
  ><a name="page434"></a>{434}</span>Sir Jonathan Wathen Waller is,
  according to the tradition of his family, descended." This pedigree is
  set out in Burke's Peerage, which assigns as arms to this family the old
  coat of Waller of Groombridge, with the augmented crest, viz.: "On a
  mount vert, a walnut-tree proper, and pendent therefrom an escutcheon of
  the arms of France with a label of three points argent." Considerable
  doubt, however, is thrown upon the descent by the fact that in 1814, when
  Sir Jonathan (then Mr. Phipps) obtained a Royal Licence to assume the
  name and arms of Waller, a very different and much bedevilled edition of
  the arms and not the real coat of Waller of Groombridge was exemplified
  to him. These supporters (the grant was quite <i>ultra vires</i>, Sir
  Jonathan being a domiciled Englishman) do not appear in any of the
  Peerage books, and it is not clear to what extent they were ever made use
  of, but in a painting which came under my notice the Duke of Orleans, in
  his surcoat of France, could be observed handing his sword across the
  front of the escutcheon to Mr. (or Sir) Richard Waller. The supporters of
  the Needlemakers' Company are commonly known as Adam and Eve, and the
  motto of the Company ["They sewed fig-leaves together and made themselves
  aprons"] bears this supposition out. The blazon, however, is: "Dexter, a
  man; sinister, a woman, both proper, each wreathed round the waist with
  leaves of the last, in the woman's dexter hand a needle or." The
  supporters of the Earl of Aberdeen are, "dexter an Earl and sinister a
  Doctor of Laws, both in their robes all proper."</p>

  <p>Highlanders in modern costume figure as supporters to the arms of
  Maconochie-Wellwood, and in more ancient garb in the case of Cluny
  Macpherson, and soldiers in the uniforms of every regiment, and savages
  from every clime, have at some time or other been pressed into heraldic
  service as supporters; but a work on Armory is not a handbook on costume,
  military and civil, nor is it an ethnographical directory, which it would
  certainly become if any attempt were to be made to enumerate the
  different varieties of men and women, clothed and unclothed, which have
  been used for the purposes of supporters.</p>

<h5>ANIMALS AS SUPPORTERS</h5>

  <p>When we turn to animals as supporters, we at once get to a much wider
  range, and but little can be said concerning them beyond stating that
  though usually rampant, they are sometimes sejant, and may be guardant or
  regardant. One may, however, append examples of the work of different
  artists, which will doubtless serve as models, or possibly may develop
  ideas in other artists. The <i>Lion</i> naturally first claims <!-- Page
  435 --><span class="pagenum" title="491.png"><a
  name="page435"></a>{435}</span>one's attention. Fig. 670 shows an
  interesting and curious instance of the use of a single lion as a
  supporter. This is taken from a drawing in the possession of the town
  library at Breslau (<i>Herold</i>, 1888, No. 1), and represents the arms
  of Dr. Heinrich Rubische, Physician to the King of Hungary and Bohemia.
  The arms are, "per fesse," the chief argent, a "point" throughout sable,
  charged with a lion's face, holding in the jaws an annulet, and the base
  also argent charged with two bars sable. The mantling is sable and
  argent. Upon the helmet as crest are two buffalo's horns of the colours
  of the shield, and between them appears (apparently as a part of the
  heritable crest) a lion's face holding an annulet as in the arms. This,
  however, is the face of the lion, which, standing behind the escutcheon,
  is employed as the supporter, though possibly it is intended that it
  should do double duty. This employment of one animal to serve a double
  armorial purpose is practically unknown in British armory, except
  possibly in a few early examples of seals, but in German heraldry it is
  very far from being uncommon.</p>

<p><!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum" title="492.png"><a name="page436"></a>{436}</span></p>

  <p>Winged lions are not very usual, but they occur as the supporters of
  Lord Braye: "On either side a lion guardant or, winged vair." A winged
  lion is also one of the supporters (the dexter) of Lord Leconfield, but
  this, owing to the position of the wings, is quite unique. The blazon is:
  "A lion with wings inverted azure, collared or." Two lions rampant
  double-queued, the dexter or, the sinister sable, are the supporters of
  the Duke of Portland, and the supporters of both the Earl of Feversham
  and the Earl of Dartmouth afford instances of lions crowned with a
  coronet, and issuing therefrom a plume of ostrich feathers.</p>

  <p>Sea-lions will be found as supporters to the arms of Viscount Falmouth
  ["Two sea-lions erect on their tails argent, gutté-de-l'armes"], and the
  Earl of Howth bears: "Dexter, a sea-lion as in the crest; sinister, a
  mermaid proper, holding in her exterior hand a mirror."</p>

  <p>The heraldic tiger is occasionally found as a supporter, and an
  instance occurs in the arms of the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava. It also
  occurs as the sinister supporter of the Duke of Leeds, and of the
  Baroness Darcy de Knayth, and was the dexter supporter of the Earls of
  Holderness. Two heraldic tigers are the supporters both of Sir Andrew
  Noel Agnew, Bart., and of the Marquess of Anglesey. Of recent years the
  natural tiger has taken its place in the heraldic menagerie, and
  instances of its appearance will be found in the arms of Sir Mortimer
  Durand, and as one of the supporters of the arms of the city of Bombay.
  When occurring in heraldic surroundings it is always termed for
  distinction a "Bengal tiger," and two Royal Bengal tigers are the
  supporters of Sir Francis Outram, Bart.: "On either side a Royal Bengal
  tiger guardant proper, gorged with a wreath of laurel vert, and on the
  head an Eastern crown or."</p>

  <p>The griffin is perhaps the next most favourite supporter. Male
  griffins are the supporters of Sir George John Egerton Dashwood: "On
  either side a male gryphon argent, gorged with a collar flory
  counterflory gules."</p>

  <p>A very curious supporter is borne by Mr. Styleman Le Strange. Of
  course, as a domiciled English commoner, having no Royal Licence to bear
  supporters, his claim to these additions would not be recognised, but
  their use no doubt originated in the fact that he represents the lines of
  several coheirships to different baronies by writ, to some one of which,
  no doubt, the supporters may have at some time belonged. The dexter
  supporter in question is "a stag argent with a lion's forepaws and tail,
  collared."</p>

  <p>The supporters recently granted to Lord Milner are two "springbok,"
  and the same animal (an "oryx" or "springbok") is the sinister supporter
  of the arms of Cape Colony. <!-- Page 437 --><span class="pagenum" title="493.png"
  ><a name="page437"></a>{437}</span></p>

  <p>Goats are the supporters of the Earl of Portsmouth (who styles his
  "chamois or wild goats"), of Lord Bagot and Lord Cranworth, and they
  occur in the achievements of the Barony of Ruthven and the Marquess of
  Normanby. The supporters of Viscount Southwell are two "Indian"
  goats.</p>

  <p>Rams are the supporters of Lord de Ramsey and Lord Sherard. A ram is
  also one of the supporters attached to the Barony of Ruthven, and one of
  the supporters used by the town of New Galloway. These arms, however,
  have never been matriculated, which on account of the curious charge upon
  the shield is very much to be regretted.</p>

  <p>The supporters of Lord Mowbray and Stourton afford an example of a
  most curious and interesting animal. Originally the Lords Stourton used
  two antelopes azure, but before the seventeenth century these had been
  changed to two "sea-dogs." When the abeyance of the Barony of Mowbray was
  determined in favour of Lord Stourton the dexter supporter was changed to
  the lion of Mowbray, but the sinister supporter still remained a
  "sea-dog."</p>

  <p>The horse and the pegasus are constantly met with supporting the arms
  of peers and others in this country. A bay horse regardant figures as the
  dexter supporter of the Earl of Yarborough, and the horses which support
  the shield of Earl Cowper are very specifically detailed in the official
  blazon: "Two dun horses close cropped (except a tuft upon the withers)
  and docked, a large blaze down the face, a black list down the back, and
  three white feet, viz. the hind-feet and near fore-foot." Lord Joicey has
  two Shetland ponies and Lord Winterstoke has "two horses sable, maned,
  tailed, and girthed or."</p>

  <p>The arms of the City of London are always used with dragons for
  supporters, but these supporters are not officially recorded. The arms of
  the City of London are referred to at greater length elsewhere in these
  pages. The town of Appleby uses dragons with wings expanded (most
  fearsome creatures), but these are not official, nor are the "dragons
  sejant addorsed gules, each holding an ostrich feather argent affixed to
  a scroll" which some enterprising artist designed for Cheshire. Dragons
  will be found as supporters to the arms of the Earl of Enniskillen, Lord
  St. Oswald, the Earl of Castlestuart, and Viscount Arbuthnot. The
  heraldic dragon is not the only form of the creature now known to armory.
  The Chinese dragon was granted to Lord Gough as one of his supporters,
  and it has since also been granted as a supporter to Sir Robert Hart,
  Bart.</p>

  <p>Wyverns are the supporters of the Earl of Meath and Lord Burghclere,
  and the sinister supporter of both Lord Raglan and Lord Lyveden. <!--
  Page 438 --><span class="pagenum" title="494.png"><a
  name="page438"></a>{438}</span></p>

  <p>The arms of the Royal Burgh of Dundee are quite unique. The official
  blazon runs: "Azure, a pott of growing lillies argent, the escutcheon
  being supported by two dragons, their tails nowed together underneath
  vert, with this word in an escroll above a lilie growing out of the top
  of the shield as the former, 'Dei Donum.'" Though blazoned as dragons,
  the creatures are undoubtedly wyverns.</p>

  <p>Wyverns when figuring as supporters are usually represented standing
  on the one claw and supporting the shield with the other, but in the case
  of the Duke of Marlborough, whose supporters are two wyverns, these are
  generally represented sejant erect, supporting the shield with both
  claws. This position is also adopted for the wyvern supporters of Sir
  Robert Arbuthnot, Bart., and the Earl of Eglinton.</p>

  <p>Two cockatrices are the supporters of Lord Donoughmore, the Earl of
  Westmeath, and Sir Edmund Nugent, Bart., and the dexter supporter of Lord
  Lanesborough is also a cockatrice.</p>

  <p>The basilisk is the same creature as the cockatrice, and in the arms
  of the town of Basle (German Basel), is an example of a supporter
  blazoned as a basilisk. The arms are: "Argent, a crosier sable." The
  supporter is a basilisk vert, armed and jelloped gules.</p>

  <p>The supporters of the Plasterers' Company, which were granted with the
  arms (January 15, 1556), are: "Two opinaci (figures very similar to
  griffins) vert pursted (? purfled) or, beaked sable, the wings gules."
  The dexter supporter of the arms of Cape Colony is a "gnu."</p>

  <p>The zebra, the giraffe, and the okapi are as yet unclaimed as
  supporters, though the giraffe, under the name of the camelopard, figures
  in some number of cases as a crest, and there is at least one instance
  (Kemsley) of a zebra as a crest. The ass, though there are some number of
  cases in which it appears as a crest or a charge, does not yet figure
  anywhere as a supporter, nor does the mule. The hyena, the sacred cow of
  India, the bison, the giant-sloth, and the armadillo are all distinctive
  animals which still remain to be withdrawn from the heraldic "lucky bag"
  of Garter. The mythical human-faced winged bull of Egyptian mythology,
  the harpy, and the female centaur would lend themselves well to the
  character of supporters.</p>

  <p>Robertson of Struan has no supporters matriculated with his arms, and
  it is difficult to say for what length of time the supporters now in use
  have been adopted. But he is chief of his name, and the representative of
  one of the minor barons, so that there is no doubt that supporters would
  be matriculated to him if he cared to apply. Those supporters in use,
  viz. "Dexter, a serpent; sinister, a dove, the heads of each encircled
  with rays," must surely be no less unique than is the strange
  compartment, "a wild man lying in chains," which is borne <!-- Page 439
  --><span class="pagenum" title="495.png"><a
  name="page439"></a>{439}</span>below the arms of Struan Robertson, and
  which was granted to his ancestor in 1451 for arresting the murderers of
  King James I.</p>

  <p>The supporters belonging to the city of Glasgow<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> are also unique, being two salmon, each
  holding a signet-ring in the mouth.</p>

  <p>The supporters of the city of Waterford, though not recorded in
  Ulster's Office, have been long enough in use to ensure their official
  "confirmation" if a request to this effect were to be properly put
  forward. They are, on the dexter side a lion, and on the sinister side a
  dolphin. Two dolphins azure, finned or, are the supporters of the
  Watermen and Lightermen's Livery Company, and were granted 1655.</p>

<h5>BIRDS AS SUPPORTERS</h5>

  <p>Whilst eagles are plentiful as supporters, nevertheless if eagles are
  eliminated the proportion of supporters which are birds is not great.</p>

  <p>A certain variety and differentiation is obtained by altering the
  position of the wings, noticeably in regard to eagles, but these
  differences do not appear to be by any means closely adhered to by
  artists in pictorial representations of armorial bearings.</p>

  <p>Fig. 671 ought perhaps more properly to have been placed amongst those
  eagles which, appearing as single figures, carry shields charged upon the
  breast, but in the present case, in addition to the shield charged upon
  it in the usual manner, it so palpably supports the two other
  escutcheons, that we are tempted to include it amongst definite
  supporters. The figure represents the arms of the free city of Nürnberg,
  and the design is reproduced from the title-page of the German edition of
  Andreas Vesili's <i>Anatomia</i>, printed at Nürnberg in 1537. The eagle
  is that of the German Empire, carrying on its breast the impaled arms of
  Castile and Austria. The shields it supports may now be said both to
  belong to Nürnberg. The dexter shield, which is the coloured seal device
  of the old Imperial city, is: "Azure, a harpy (in German
  <i>frauenadler</i> or maiden eagle) displayed and crowned or." The
  sinister shield (which may more properly be considered the real arms of
  Nürnberg) is: "Per pale or, a double-headed Imperial eagle displayed,
  dimidiated with bendy of six gules and argent." <!-- Page 440 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="496.png"><a name="page440"></a>{440}</span></p>

  <p>The supporters of Lord Amherst of Hackney are two <i>Herons</i>: "On
  either side a heron proper, collared or."</p>

  approximate to storks. Two woodpeckers have recently been granted as the

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXVII</h5>

<h5>THE COMPARTMENT</h5>

  <p>A compartment is anything depicted below the shield as a foothold or
  resting-place for the supporters, or indeed for the shield itself.
  Sometimes it is a fixed part of the blazon and a constituent part of the
  heritable heraldic bearings. At other times it is a matter of mere
  artistic fancy, and no fixed rules exist to regulate or control nor even
  to check the imagination of the heraldic artist. The fact remains that
  supporters must have something to stand upon, and if the blazon supplies
  nothing, the discretion of the artist is allowed considerable laxity.</p>

  <p>On the subject of compartments a great deal of diversity of opinion
  exists. There is no doubt that in early days and early examples
  supporters were placed to stand upon some secure footing, but with the
  decadence of heraldic art in the seventeenth century came the
  introduction of the gilded "freehand copy" scroll with which we are so
  painfully familiar, which one writer has aptly termed the heraldic
  gas-bracket. Arising doubtless from and following upon the earlier habit
  of balancing the supporters upon the unstable footing afforded by the
  edge of the motto scroll, the "gas-bracket" was probably accepted as less
  open to objection. It certainly was not out of keeping with the heraldic
  art of the period to which it owed its evolution, or with the style of
  armorial design of which it formed a part. It still remains the accepted
  and "official" style and type in England, but Scotland and Ireland have
  discarded it, and "compartments" in those countries are now depicted of a
  nature requiring less gymnastic ability on the part of the animals to
  which they afford a foothold. The style of compartment is practically
  always a matter of artistic taste and design. With a few exceptions it is
  always entirely disregarded in the blazon of the patent, and the
  necessity of something for the supporters to stand upon is as much an
  understood thing as is the existence of a shield whereon the arms are to
  be displayed. But as the shape of the shield is left to the fancy of the
  artist, so is the character of the compartment, and the Lyon Register
  nowadays affords examples of achievements where the supporters stand on
  rocks and flowery mounds <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum" title="498.png"
  ><a name="page442"></a>{442}</span>or issue from a watery abiding-place.
  The example set by the Lyon Register has been eagerly followed by most
  heraldic artists.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/fig672.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig672.png"
      alt="Fig. 672." title="Fig. 672." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 672.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>It is a curious commentary upon the heraldic art of the close of the
  eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth centuries that whilst the
  gymnastic capabilities of animals were admitted to be equal to
  "tight-rope" exhibitions of balancing upon the ordinary scroll, these
  feats were not considered practicable in the case of human beings, for
  whom little square platforms were always provided. Fig. 672, which
  represents the sinister supporter of Lord Scarsdale (viz. the figure of
  Liberality represented by a woman habited argent, mantled purpure,
  holding a cornucopia proper) shows the method by which platform
  accommodation was provided for human figures when acting as
  supporters.</p>

  <p>At the same time this greater freedom of design may occasionally lead
  to mistakes in relation to English supporters and their compartments.
  Following upon the English practice already referred to of
  differentiating the supporters of different families, it has apparently
  been found necessary in some cases to place the supporters to stand upon
  a definite object, which object is recited in the blazon and becomes an
  integral and unchangeable portion of the supporter. Thus Lord
  Torrington's supporters are each placed upon dismounted ships' guns
  ["Dexter, an heraldic antelope ermine, horned, tusked, maned and hoofed
  or, standing on a ship gun proper; sinister, a sea-horse proper, on a
  like gun"], Lord Hawke's<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> dexter supporter rests his sinister
  foot upon a dolphin, and Lord Herschell's supporters each stand upon a
  fasces ["Supporters: on either side a stag proper, collared azure,
  standing on a fasces or"]. The supporters of Lord Iveagh each rest a
  hind-foot upon an escutcheon ["Supporters: on either side a stag gules,
  attired and collared gemel or, resting the inner hoof on an escutcheon
  vert charged with a lion rampant of the second"], whilst the inner
  hind-foot of each of Lord Burton's supporters <!-- Page 443 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="499.png"><a name="page443"></a>{443}</span>rests
  upon a stag's head caboshed proper. Probably absurdity could go no
  further. But in the case of the supporters granted to Cape Town (Fig.
  673), the official blazon runs as follows: "On the dexter <!-- Page 444
  --><span class="pagenum" title="500.png"><a
  name="page444"></a>{444}</span>side, standing on a rock, a female figure
  proper, vested argent, mantle and sandals azure, on her head an estoile
  radiated or, and supporting with her exterior hand an anchor also proper;
  and on the sinister side, standing on a like rock, a lion rampant
  guardant gules." In this case it will be seen that the rocks form an
  integral part of the supporters, and are not merely an artistic rendering
  of the compartment. The illustration, which was made from an official
  drawing supplied from the Heralds' College, shows the curious way in
  which the motto scroll is made to answer the purpose of the
  compartment.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/fig673.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig673.png"
      alt="Fig. 673." title="Fig. 673." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig. 673.</span>&mdash;Arms
    of Cape Town: Or, an anchor erect sable, stock proper, from the ring a
    riband flowing azure, and suspended therefrom an escocheon gules
    charged with three annulets of the field; and for the crest, on a
    wreath of the colours, upon the battlements of a tower proper, a
    trident in bend dexter or, surmounted by an anchor and cable in bend
    sinister sable.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Occasionally the compartment itself&mdash;as a thing apart from the
  supporters&mdash;receives attention in the blazon, <i>e.g.</i> in the
  case of the arms of Baron de Worms, which are of foreign origin, recorded
  in this country by Royal Warrant. His supporters are: "On a bronze
  compartment, on either side a lion gold, collared and chained or, and
  pendent from the compartment a golden scroll, thereon in letters gules
  the motto, 'Vinctus non victus.'"</p>

  <p>In the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom the motto "Dieu et mon Droit"
  is required to be on the compartment below the shield, and thereon the
  Union Badge of the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock engrafted on the same
  stem.</p>

  <p>The city of Norwich is not officially recognised as having the right
  to supporters, and doubtless those in use have originated in the old
  artistic custom, previously referred to, of putting escutcheons of arms
  under the guardianship of angels. They may be so deciphered upon an old
  stone carving upon one of the municipal buildings in that city. The
  result has been that two angels have been regularly adopted as the
  heraldic supporters of the city arms. The point that renders them worthy
  of notice is that they are invariably represented each standing upon its
  own little pile of clouds.</p>

  <p>The arms of the Royal Burgh of Montrose (Forfarshire) afford an
  official instance of another variety in the way of a compartment, which
  is a fixed matter of blazon and not depending upon artistic fancy. The
  entry in Lyon Register is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The Royal Burgh of Montrose gives for Ensignes Armoriall, Argent, a
  rose gules. The shield adorned with helmet, mantling, and wreath suteable
  thereto. And for a crest, a hand issuing from a cloud and reaching down a
  garland of roses proper, supported by two mermaids aryseing from the sea
  proper. The motto, 'Mare ditat Rosa decorat.' And for a revers, Gules,
  St. Peter on the cross proper, with the keyes hanging at his girdle or.
  Which Arms, &amp;c., Ext. December 16, 1694."</p>

  <p>An English example may be found in the case of the arms of <!-- Page
  445 --><span class="pagenum" title="501.png"><a
  name="page445"></a>{445}</span>Boston,<a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> which are depicted with the supporters
  (again two mermaids) rising from the sea, though to what extent the sea
  is a fixed and unchangeable part of the achievement in this case is less
  a matter of certainty.</p>

  <p>Probably of all the curious "supporters" to be found in British
  armory, those of the city of Southampton (Plate VII.) must be admitted to
  be the most unusual. As far as the actual usage of the arms by the
  corporation is concerned, one seldom if ever sees more than the simple
  shield employed. This bears the arms: "Per fess gules and argent, three
  roses counterchanged." But in the official record of the arms in one of
  the Visitation books a crest is added, namely: "Upon a mount vert, a
  double tower or, and issuing from the upper battlements thereof a
  demi-female affronté proper, vested purpure, crined and crowned with an
  Eastern coronet also or, holding in her dexter hand a sword erect point
  upwards argent, pommel and hilt of the second, and in her sinister hand a
  balance sable, the pans gold. The shield in the Visitation book rests
  upon a mount vert, issuing from waves of the sea, and thereupon placed on
  either side of the escutcheon a ship of two masts at anchor, the sails
  furled all proper, the round top or, and from each masthead flying a
  banner of St. George, and upon the stern of each vessel a lion rampant
  or, supporting the escutcheon."</p>

  <p>From the fact that in England the compartment is so much a matter of
  course, it is scarcely ever alluded to, and the <i>term</i> "Compartment"
  is practically one peculiar to Scottish heraldry. It does not appear to
  be a very ancient heraldic appendage, and was probably found to be a
  convenient arrangement when shields were depicted erect instead of
  couché, so as to supply a resting-place (or standpoint) for the
  supporters. In a few instances the compartment appears on seals with
  couché shields, on which, however, the supporters are usually represented
  as resting <i>on the sides of the escutcheon</i>, and bearing up the
  helmet and crest, as already mentioned. Sir George Mackenzie conjectures
  that the compartment "represents the bearer's land and territories,
  though sometimes (he adds) it is bestowed in recompense of some
  honourable action." Thus the Earls of Douglas are said to have obtained
  the privilege of placing their supporters with a pale of wood wreathed,
  because the doughty lord, in the reign of King Robert the Bruce, defeated
  the English in Jedburgh Forest, and "caused wreathe and impale," during
  the night, that part of the wood by which he conjectured they might make
  their escape. Such a fenced compartment appears on the seal of James
  Douglas, second Earl of Angus, "Dominus de Abernethie et Jedworth Forest"
  (1434), on <!-- Page 446 --><span class="pagenum" title="502.png"><a
  name="page446"></a>{446}</span>that of George Douglas, fourth Earl
  (1459), and also on those of several of his successors in the earldom
  (1511-1617). A still earlier example, however, of a compartment
  "representing a park with trees, &amp;c., enclosed by a wattled fence,"
  occurs on the seal of Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl (<i>c.</i> 1430),
  where the escutcheon is placed in the entrance to the park between two
  trees. Nisbet refers to a seal of William, first Earl of Douglas (1377),
  exhibiting a single supporter (a lion) "sitting on a compartment like to
  a rising ground, with a tree growing out of it, and semé of hearts,
  mullets, and cross crosslets," these being the charges of Douglas and Mar
  in the escutcheon.</p>

  <p>According to Sir George Mackenzie, these compartments were usually
  allowed only to sovereign princes; and he further informs us that,
  besides the Douglases, he knows of no other subject in Britain, except
  the Earl of Perth, whose arms stand upon a compartment. In the case of
  the Perth family, the compartment consists of a green hill or mount, semé
  of caltraps<a name="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> (or
  cheval-traps), with the relative motto, "Gang warily," above the
  achievement. "Albeit of late," says Mackenzie, "compartments are become
  more common, and some families in Scotland have some creatures upon which
  their achievement stands, as the Laird of Dundas, whose achievement has
  for many hundreds of years stood upon a salamander in flames proper (a
  device of the kings of France), and Robertson of Struan has a monstrous
  man lying under the escutcheon chained, which was given him for his
  taking the murderer of James I...." Such figures, however, as Nisbet
  remarks, cannot properly be called compartments, having rather the
  character of devices; while, in the case of the Struan achievement, the
  chained man would be more accurately described as "an honourable
  supporter." Sir George Mackenzie engraves "the coat of Denham of ould,"
  viz. a stag's head "caboshed," below a shield couché charged with three
  lozenges, or fusils, conjoined in bend. In like manner, Nisbet represents
  the crest and motto of the Scotts of Thirlstane, "by way of compartment,"
  below the escutcheon of Lord Napier, and a blazing star, with the legend
  "Luceo boreale," under that of Captain Robert Seton, of the family of
  Meldrum; while in the case of the illumination which accompanies the
  latest entry in the first volume of the Lyon Register (1804), relative to
  the arms of John Hepburn Belshes of Invermay, the trunk of an oak-tree
  sprouting forth anew is placed on a compartment under the shield, with
  the motto, "Revirescit."</p>

  <p>Two other instances of regular compartments are mentioned by Nisbet,
  viz. those carried by the Macfarlanes of that Ilk and the Ogilvies of
  Innerquharity. The former consists of a wavy <!-- Page 447 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="503.png"><a
  name="page447"></a>{447}</span>representation of Loch Sloy, the
  gathering-place of the clan, which word is also inscribed on the
  compartment as their <i>cri-de-guerre</i> or slogan; while the latter is
  a "green hill or rising terrace," on which are placed two serpents,
  "nowed," spouting fire, and the motto, "Terrena pericula sperno." For
  some of the foregoing instances I am indebted to Seton's well-known "Law
  and Practice of Heraldry in Scotland." <!-- Page 448 --><span

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXVIII</h5>

<h5>MOTTOES</h5>

  <p>To the uninitiated, the subject of the motto of a family has a far
  greater importance than is conceded to it by those who have spent any
  time in the study of armory. Perhaps it may clear the ground if the rules
  presently in force are first recited. It should be carefully observed
  that the status of the motto is vastly different in England and in other
  countries. Except in the cases of impersonal arms (and not always then),
  the motto is never mentioned or alluded to in the terms of the patent in
  a grant of arms in England; consequently they are not a part of the
  "estate" created by the Letters Patent, though if it be desired a motto
  will always be painted below the emblazonment in the margin of the
  patent. Briefly speaking, the position in England with regard to personal
  armorial bearings is that mottoes are <i>not hereditary</i>. No one is
  compelled to bear one, nor is any authority needed for the adoption of a
  motto, the matter is left purely to the personal pleasure of every
  individual; but if that person elects to use a motto, the officers of
  arms are perfectly willing to paint any motto he may choose upon his
  grant, and to add it to the record of his arms in their books. There is
  no necessity expressed or implied to use a motto at all, nor is the
  slightest control exercised over the selection or change of mottoes,
  though, as would naturally be expected, the officers of arms would
  decline to record to any private person any motto which might have been
  appropriated to the sovereign or to any of the orders of knighthood. In
  the same way no control is exercised over the position in which the motto
  is to be carried or the manner in which it is to be displayed.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, however, the matter is on an entirely different footing.
  The motto is included within the terms of the patent, and is consequently
  made the subject of grant. It therefore becomes inalienable and
  unchangeable without a rematriculation, and a Scottish patent moreover
  always specifies the position in which the motto is to be carried. This
  is usually "in an escroll over the same" (<i>i.e.</i> over the crest),
  though occasionally it is stated to be borne on "a compartment below the
  arms." The matter in Ireland is not quite the same as in <!-- Page 449
  --><span class="pagenum" title="505.png"><a
  name="page449"></a>{449}</span>either Scotland or England. Sometimes the
  motto is expressed in the patent&mdash;in fact this is now the more usual
  alternative&mdash;but the rule is not universal, and to a certain extent
  the English permissiveness is recognised. Possibly the subject can be
  summed up in the remark that if any motto has been granted or is recorded
  with a particular coat of arms in Ireland, it is expected that that shall
  be the motto to be made use of therewith.</p>

  <p>As a general practice the use of mottoes in England did not become
  general until the eighteenth century&mdash;in fact there are very few, if
  any, grants of an earlier date on which a motto appears. The majority,
  well on towards the latter part of the eighteenth century, had no motto
  added, and many patents are still issued without such an addition. With
  rare exceptions, no mottoes are to be met with in the Visitation books,
  and it does not appear that at the time of the Visitations the motto was
  considered to be essentially a part of the armorial bearings. The one or
  two exceptions which I have met with where mottoes are to be found on
  Visitation pedigrees are in every case the arms of a peer. There are at
  least two such in the Yorkshire Visitation of 1587, and probably it may
  be taken for granted that the majority of peers at that period had begun
  to make use of these additions to their arms. Unfortunately we have no
  exact means of deciding the point, because peers were not compelled to
  attend a Visitation, and there are but few cases in which the arms or
  pedigree of a peer figure in the Visitation books. In isolated cases the
  use of a motto can, however, be traced back to an even earlier period.
  There are several instances to be met with upon the early Garter
  plates.</p>

  <p>Many writers have traced the origin of mottoes to the "slogan" or
  war-cry of battle, and there is no doubt whatever that instances can be
  found in which an ancient war-cry has become a family motto. For example,
  one can refer to the Fitzgerald "Crom-a-boo": other instances can be
  found amongst some of the Highland families, but the fact that many
  well-known war-cries of ancient days never became perpetuated as mottoes,
  and also the fact that by far the greater number of mottoes, even at a
  much earlier period than the present day, cannot by any possibility have
  ever been used for or have originated with the purposes of battle-cries,
  inclines me to believe that such a suggested origin for the motto in
  general is without adequate foundation. There can be little if any
  connection between the war-cry as such and the motto as such. The real
  origin would appear to be more correctly traced back to the badge. As
  will be found explained elsewhere, the badge was some simple device used
  for personal and household purposes and seldom for war, except by persons
  who used the badge of the leader they followed. No man wore his own badge
  <!-- Page 450 --><span class="pagenum" title="506.png"><a
  name="page450"></a>{450}</span>in battle. It generally partook of the
  nature of what ancient writers would term "a quaint conceit," and much
  ingenuity seems to have been expended in devising badges and mottoes
  which should at the same time be distinctive and should equally be or
  convey an index or suggestion of the name and family of the owner. Many
  of these badges are found in conjunction with words, mottoes, and
  phrases, and as the distinction between the badge in general and the
  crest in general slowly became less apparent, they eventually in practice
  became interchangeable devices, if the same device did not happen to be
  used for both purposes. Consequently the motto from the badge became
  attached to the crest, and was thence transferred to its present
  connection with the coat of arms. Just as at the present time a man may
  and often does adopt a maxim upon which he will model his life, some
  pithy proverb, or some trite observation, without any question or
  reference to armorial bearings&mdash;so, in the old days, when learning
  was less diffuse and when proverbs and sayings had a wider acceptance and
  vogue than at present, did many families and many men adopt for their use
  some form of words. We find these words carved on furniture, set up on a
  cornice, cut in stone, and embroidered upon standards and banners, and it
  is to this custom that we should look for the beginning of the use of
  mottoes. But because such words were afterwards in later generations
  given an armorial status, it is not justifiable to presume such status
  for them from their beginnings. The fact that a man put his badges on the
  standard that he carried into battle, and with his badges placed the
  mottoes that thereto belonged, has led many people mistakenly to believe
  that these mottoes were <i>designed</i> for war-cries and for use in
  battle. That was not the case. In fact it seems more likely that the bulk
  of the standards recorded in the books of the heralds which show a motto
  were never carried in battle.</p>

  <p>With regard to the mottoes in use at the moment, some of course can be
  traced to a remote period, and many of the later ones have interesting
  legends connected therewith. Of mottoes of this character may be
  instanced the "Jour de ma vie" of West, which was formerly the motto of
  the La Warr family, adopted to commemorate the capture of the King of
  France at the battle of Poictiers. There are many other mottoes of this
  character, amongst which may be mentioned the "Grip fast" of the Leslies,
  the origin of which is well known. But though many mottoes relate to
  incidents in the remote past, true or mythical, the motto and the
  incident are seldom contemporary. Nothing would be gained by a recital of
  a long list of mottoes, but I cannot forbear from quoting certain curious
  examples which by their very weirdness must excite curiosity as to their
  origin. A family of Martin used the singular words, "He who looks at
  Martin's <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum" title="507.png"><a
  name="page451"></a>{451}</span>ape, Martin's ape shall look at him,"
  whilst the Curzons use, "Let Curzon hold what Curzon helde." The Cranston
  motto is still more grasping, being, "Thou shalt want ere I want;" but
  probably the motto of the Dakyns is the most mysterious of all, "Strike
  Dakyns, the devil's in the hempe." The motto of Corbet, "Deus pascit
  corvos," evidently alludes to the raven or ravens (corby crows) upon the
  shield. The mottoes of Trafford, "Now thus," and "Gripe griffin, hold
  fast;" the curious Pilkington motto, "Pilkington Pailedown, the master
  mows the meadows;" and the "Serva jugum" of Hay have been the foundation
  of many legends. The "Fuimus" of the Bruce family is a pathetic allusion
  to the fact that they were once kings, but the majority of ancient
  mottoes partake rather of the nature of a pun upon the name, which fact
  is but an additional argument towards the supposition that the motto has
  more relation to the badge than to any other part of the armorial
  bearings. Of mottoes which have a punning character may be mentioned "Mon
  Dieu est ma roche," which is the motto of Roche, Lord Fermoy; "Cavendo
  tutus," which is the motto of Cavendish; "Forte scutum salus ducum,"
  which is the motto of Fortescue; "Set on," which is the motto of Seton;
  "Da fydd" of Davies, and "Ver non semper viret," the well-known pun of
  the Vernons. Another is the apocryphal "Quid rides" which Theodore Hook
  suggested for the wealthy and retired tobacconist. This punning character
  has of late obtained much favour, and wherever a name lends itself to a
  pun the effort seems nowadays to be made that the motto shall be of this
  nature. Perhaps the best pun which exists is to be found in the motto of
  the Barnard family, who, with arms "Argent, a bear rampant sable, muzzled
  or," and crest "A demi-bear as in the arms," use for the motto, "Bear and
  Forbear," or in Latin, as it is sometimes used, "Fer et perfer." Others
  that may be alluded to are the "What I win I keep" of Winlaw; the
  "Libertas" of Liberty; the "Ubi crux ibi lux" of Sir William Crookes; the
  "Bear thee well" of Bardwell; the "Gare le pied fort" of Bedford; the
  "Gare la bête" of Garbett; and the "Cave Deus videt" of Cave. Other
  mottoes&mdash;and they are a large proportion&mdash;are of some saintly
  and religious tendency. However desirable and acceptable they may be, and
  however accurately they may apply to the first possessor, they sometimes
  are sadly inappropriate to later and more degenerate successors.</p>

  <p>In Germany, a distinction appears to be drawn between their
  "Wahlsprüche" (<i>i.e.</i> those which are merely dictated by personal
  choice) and the "armorial mottoes" which remained constantly and
  heritably attached to the armorial bearings, such as the "Gott mit uns"
  ("God with us") of Prussia and the "Nihil sine Deus" of Hohenzollern.
  <!-- Page 452 --><span class="pagenum" title="508.png"><a
  name="page452"></a>{452}</span></p>

  <p>The Initial or Riddle Mottoes appear to be peculiar to Germany.
  Well-known examples of these curiosities are the "W. G. W." (<i>i.e.</i>
  "Wie Gott will"&mdash;"As God wills"), or "W. D. W." (<i>i.e.</i> "Wie du
  willst"&mdash;"As thou wilt"), which are both frequently to be met with.
  The strange but well-known alphabet or vowel-motto "A. E. I. O. V." of
  the Emperor Frederick III. has been variously translated, "Aquila Electa
  Juste Omnia Vincit" ("The chosen eagle vanquishes all by right"), "Aller
  Ehren Ist Oesterrich Voll" ("Austria is full of every honour"), or
  perhaps with more likelihood, "Austria Est Imperare Orbe Universo" ("All
  the earth is subject to Austria").</p>

  <p>The <i>cri-de-guerre</i>, both as a heraldic fact and as an armorial
  term, is peculiar, and exclusively so, to British and French heraldry.
  The national <i>cri-de-guerre</i> of France, "Montjoye Saint Denis,"
  appeared above the pavilion in the old Royal Arms of France, and probably
  the English Royal motto, "Dieu et mon Droit," is correctly traced to a
  similar origin. A distinction is still made in modern heraldry between
  the <i>cri-de-guerre</i> and the motto, inasmuch as it is considered that
  the former should always of necessity surmount the crest. This is very
  generally adhered to in Scotland in the cases where both a motto and a
  <i>cri-de-guerre</i> (or, as it is frequently termed in that country, a
  "slogan") exist, the motto, contrary to the usual Scottish practice,
  being then placed below the shield. It is to be hoped that a general
  knowledge of this fact will not, however, result in the description of
  every motto found above a crest as a <i>cri-de-guerre</i>, and certainly
  the concentrated piety now so much in favour in England for the purposes
  of a motto can be quite fitly left below the shield.</p>

  <p>Artists do not look kindly on the motto for decorative purposes. It
  has been usually depicted in heraldic emblazonment in black letters upon
  a white scroll, tinted and shaded with pink, but with the present revival
  of heraldic art, it has become more general to paint the motto ribbon in
  conformity with the colour of the field, the letters being often shown
  thereon in gold. The colour and shape of the motto ribbon, however, are
  governed by no heraldic laws, and except in Scottish examples should be
  left, as they are purely unimportant accessories of the achievement,
  wholly at the discretion of the artist. <!-- Page 453 --><span

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXIX</h5>

<h5>BADGES</h5>

  <p>The exact status of the badge in this country, to which it is
  peculiar, has been very much misunderstood. This is probably due to the
  fact that the evolution of the badge was gradual, and that its importance
  increased unconsciously. Badges do not formerly appear to have ever been
  made the subjects of grants, and the instances which can be referred to
  showing their control, or attempted control, by the Crown in past times
  are <i>very rare indeed</i>. As a matter of fact, the Crown seems to have
  perhaps purposely ignored them. They are not, as we know them, found in
  the earliest times of heraldry, unless we are to presume their existence
  from early seals, many of which show isolated charges taken from the
  arms; for if in the cases where such charges appear upon the seals we are
  to accept those seals as proofs of the contemporary existence of those
  devices as heraldic badges, we should often be led into strange
  conclusions.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that these isolated devices which are met with were
  not only a part of the arms, but in many cases the <i>origin</i> of the
  arms. Devices possessing a more or less personal and possessive character
  occur in many cases before record of the arms they later developed into
  can be traced. This will be noticed in relation to the arms of Swinton,
  to which reference is made elsewhere. If these are badges, then badges go
  back to an earlier date than arms. Such devices occur many centuries
  before such a thing as a shield of arms existed.</p>

  <p>The <i>Heraldic Badge, as we know it</i>, came into general use about
  the reign of Edward III., that is, the heraldic badge as a separate
  matter having a distinct existence in addition to concurrent arms, and
  having at the same time a distinctly heraldic character. But long before
  that date, badges are found with an allied reference to a particular
  person, which very possibly are rightly included in any enumeration of
  badges. Of such a character is the badge of the broom plant, which is
  found upon the tomb of Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, from which badge the
  name of the Plantagenet dynasty originated (Plantagenet, by the way, was
  never a personal surname, but was the name of the dynasty). <!-- Page 454
  --><span class="pagenum" title="510.png"><a
  name="page454"></a>{454}</span></p>

  <p>It is doubtful, however, if at that early period there existed much if
  indeed any opportunity for the use of heraldic badges. At the same time,
  as far back as the reign of Richard I.&mdash;and some writers would take
  examples of a still more remote period&mdash;these badges must have been
  occasionally depicted upon banners, for Richard I. appears to have had a
  dragon upon one of his banners.</p>

  <p>These banner decorations, which at a later date have been often
  accepted as badges, can hardly be quite properly so described, for there
  are many cases where no other proof of usage can be found, and there is
  no doubt that many such are instances of no more than banners prepared
  for specific purposes; and the record of such and such a banner cannot
  necessarily carry proof that the owner of the banner claimed or used the
  objects depicted thereupon as personal badges. If they are to be so
  included some individuals must have revelled in a multitude of
  badges.</p>

  <p>But the difficulty in deciding the point very greatly depends upon the
  definition of the badge; and if we are to take the definition according
  to the manner of acceptance and usage at the period when the use of
  badges was greatest, then many of the earliest cannot be taken as coming
  within the limits.</p>

  <p>In later Plantagenet days, badges were of considerable importance, and
  certain characteristics are plainly marked. They were never worn by the
  owner&mdash;in the sense in which he carried his shield, or bore his
  crest; they were his sign-mark indicative of ownership; they were stamped
  upon his belongings in the same way in which Government property is
  marked with the broad arrow, and they were worn by his servants. They
  were worn not only by his retainers, but very probably were also worn
  more or less temporarily by adherents of his party if he were big enough
  to lead a party in the State. At all times badges had very extensive
  decorative use.</p>

  <p>There was never any fixed form for the badge; there was never any
  fixed manner of usage. I can find no fixed laws of inheritance, no common
  method of assumption. In fact the use of a badge, in the days when
  everybody who was anybody possessed arms, was quite subsidiary to the
  arms, and very much akin to the manner in which nowadays monograms are
  made use of. At the same time care must be taken to distinguish the
  "badge" from the "rebus," and also from the temporary devices which we
  read about as having been so often adopted for the purpose of the
  tournament when the combatant desired his identity to be concealed.
  Modern novelists and poets give us plenty of illustrations of the latter
  kind, but proof of the fact even that they were ever adopted in that form
  is by no means easy to find, though their professedly temporary nature of
  course militates against <!-- Page 455 --><span class="pagenum" title="511.png"
  ><a name="page455"></a>{455}</span>the likelihood of contemporary
  <i>record</i>. The rebus had never an heraldic status, and it had seldom
  more than a temporary existence. A fanciful device adopted (we hear of
  many such instances) for the temporary purpose of a tournament could
  generally be so classed, but the rebus proper has some device, usually a
  pictorial rendering of the name of the person for whom it stood. In such
  a category would be included printers' and masons' marks, but probably
  the definition of Dr. Johnson of the word rebus, as a word represented by
  a picture, is as good a definition and description as can be given. The
  rebus in its nature is a different thing from a badge, and may best be
  described as a pictorial signature, the most frequent occasion for its
  use being in architectural surroundings, where it was constantly
  introduced as a pun upon some name which it was desired to perpetuate.
  The best-known and perhaps the most typical and characteristic rebus is
  that of Islip, the builder of part of Westminster Abbey. Here the
  pictured punning representation of his name had nothing to do with his
  armorial bearings or personal badge; but the great difficulty, in dealing
  with both badges and rebuses, is the difficulty of knowing which is
  which, for very frequently the same or a similar device was used for both
  purposes. Parker, in his glossary of heraldic terms, gives several
  typical examples of rebuses which very aptly illustrate their status and
  meaning. At Lincoln College at Oxford, and on other buildings connected
  with Thomas Beckynton, Bishop of Bath and Wells, will be found carved the
  rebus of a beacon issuing from a tun. This is found in conjunction with
  the letter T for his Christian name, Thomas. Now this design was not his
  coat of arms, and was not his crest, nor was it his badge. Another rebus
  which is found at Canterbury shows an ox and the letters N, E, as the
  rebus of John Oxney. A rebus which indicates Thomas Conyston, Abbot of
  Cirencester, which can be found in Gloucester Cathedral, is a comb and a
  tun, and the printer's mark of Richard Grifton, which is a good example
  of a rebus and its use, was a tree, or graft, growing on a tun. In none
  of these cases are the designs mentioned on any part of the arms, crest,
  or badge of the persons mentioned. Rebuses of this character abound on
  all our ancient buildings, and their use has lately come very prominently
  into favour in connection with the many allusive bookplates, the design
  of which originates in some play upon the name. The words "device,"
  "ensign," and "cognisance" have no definite heraldic meaning, and are
  used impartially to apply to the crest, the badge, and sometimes to the
  arms upon the shield, so that they may be eliminated from consideration.
  There remains therefore the crest and the badge between which to draw a
  definite line of distinction. The real difference lay in the method of
  use, though there is usually a difference of form, <!-- Page 456 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="512.png"><a
  name="page456"></a>{456}</span>recognisable by an expert, but difficult
  to put into words. The crest was the ornament upon the helmet, seldom if
  ever actually worn, and never used except by the person to whom it
  belonged. The badge, on the other hand, was never placed upon the helmet,
  but was worn by the servants and retainers, and was used right and left
  on the belongings of the owner as a sign of his ownership. So great and
  extensive at one period was the use of these badges, that they were far
  more generally employed than either arms or crest, and whilst the
  knowledge of a man's badge or badges would be everyday knowledge and
  common repute throughout the kingdom, few people would know that man's
  crest, fewer still would ever have seen it worn.</p>

  <p>It is merely an exaggeration of the difficulty that we are always in
  uncertainty whether any given device was merely a piece of decoration
  borrowed from the arms or crest, or whether it had continued usage as a
  badge. In the same way many families who had never used crests, but who
  had used badges, took the opportunity of the Visitations to record their
  badges as crests. A notable example of the subsequent record of a badge
  as a crest is met with in the Stourton family. Their crest, originally a
  buck's head, but after the marriage with the heiress of Le Moigne, a
  demi-monk, can be readily substantiated, as can their badge of the drag
  or sledge. At one of the Visitations, however, a cadet of the Stourton
  family recorded the sledge as a crest. Uncertainty also arises from the
  lack of precision in the diction employed at all periods, the words
  badge, device, and crest having so often been used interchangeably.</p>

  <p>Another difficulty which is met with in regard to badges is that, with
  the exception of the extensive records of the Royal badges and some other
  more or less informal lists of badges of the principal personages at
  different periods, badges were never a subject of official record, and
  whilst it is difficult to determine the initial point as to whether any
  particular device is a badge or not, the difficulty of deducing rules
  concerning badges becomes practically impossible, and after most careful
  consideration I have come to the conclusion that there were never any
  hard and fast rules relating to badges, that they were originally and
  were allowed to remain matters of personal fancy, and that although
  well-known cases can be found where the same badge has been used
  generation after generation, those cases may perhaps be the exception
  rather than the rule. Badges should be considered and accepted in the
  general run as not being matters of permanence, and as of little
  importance except during the time from about the reign of Edward III. to
  about the reign of Henry VIII. Their principal use upon the clothes of
  the retainers came to an end by the creation of the standing army, the
  beginning of which can be traced to the reign of Henry VIII., and as
  badges never had any ceremonial use to perpetuate <!-- Page 457 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="513.png"><a name="page457"></a>{457}</span>their
  status, their importance almost ceased altogether at that period except
  as regards the Royal family.</p>

  <p>Speaking broadly, regularised and <i>recorded</i> heraldic control as
  a matter of operative fact dates little if any further back than the end
  of the reign of Henry VIII., consequently badges originally do not appear
  to have been taken much cognisance of by the Heralds. Their actual use
  from that period onwards rapidly declined, and hence the absence of
  record.</p>

  <p>Though the use of badges has become very restricted, there are still
  one or two occasions on which badges are used as badges, in the style
  formerly in vogue. Perhaps the case which is most familiar is the broad
  arrow which is used to mark Government stores. It is a curious commentary
  upon heraldic officialdom and its ways that though this is the only badge
  which has really any extensive use, it is not a Crown badge in any
  degree. Although this origin has been disputed it is said to have
  originated in the fact that one of the Sydney family, when Master of the
  Ordnance, to prevent disputes as to the stores for which he was
  responsible, marked everything with his private badge of the broad arrow,
  and this private badge has since remained in constant use. One wonders at
  what date the officers of His Majesty will observe that this has become
  one of His Majesty's recognised badges, and will include it with the
  other Royal badges in the warrants in which they are recited. Already
  more than two centuries have passed since it first came into use, and
  either they should represent to the Government that the pheon is not a
  Crown mark, and that some recognised Royal badge should be used in its
  place, or else they should place its status upon a definite footing.</p>

  <p>Another instance of a badge used at the present day in the ancient
  manner is the conjoined rose, thistle, and shamrock which is embroidered
  front and back upon the tunics of the Beefeaters and the Yeomen of the
  Guard. The crowned harps which are worn by the Royal Irish Constabulary
  are another instance of the kind, but though a certain number of badges
  are recited in the warrant each time any alteration or declaration of the
  Royal Arms occurs, their use has now become very limited. Present badges
  are the crowned rose for England, the crowned thistle for Scotland, and
  the crowned trefoil and the crowned harp for Ireland; whilst for the
  Union there is the conjoined rose, thistle, and shamrock under the crown,
  and the crowned shield which carries the device of the Union Jack. The
  badge of Wales, which has existed for long enough, is the uncrowned
  dragon upon a mount vert, and the crowned cyphers, one within and one
  without the Garter, are also depicted upon the warrant. These badges,
  which appear on the Sovereign's warrant, are never assigned to any other
  member of the Royal Family, of whom <!-- Page 458 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="514.png"><a name="page458"></a>{458}</span>the
  Prince of Wales is the only one who rejoices in the possession of
  officially assigned badges. The badge of the eldest son of the Sovereign,
  as such, and not as Prince of Wales, is the plume of three ostrich
  feathers, enfiled with the circlet from his coronet. Recently an
  additional badge (on a mount vert, a dragon passant gules, charged on the
  shoulder with a label of three points argent) has been assigned to His
  Royal Highness. This action was taken with the desire to in some way
  gratify the forcibly expressed wishes of Wales, and it is probable that,
  the precedent having been set, it will be assigned to all those who may
  bear the title of Prince of Wales in future.</p>

  <p>The only instances I am personally aware of in which a real badge of
  ancient origin is still worn by the servants are the cases of the state
  liveries of the Earl of Yarborough, whose servants wear an embroidered
  buckle, and of Lord Mowbray and Stourton, whose servants wear an
  embroidered sledge. The family of Daubeney of Cote still bear the old
  Daubeney badge of the pair of bat's wings; Lord Stafford still uses his
  "Stafford knot." I believe the servants of Lord Braye still wear the
  badge of the hemp-brake, and those of the Earl of Loudoun wear the
  Hastings maunch; and doubtless there are a few other instances. When the
  old families were becoming greatly reduced in number, and the nobility
  and the upper classes were being recruited from families of later origin,
  the wearing of badges, like so much else connected with heraldry, became
  lax in its practice.</p>

  <p>The servants of all the great nobles in ancient days appear to have
  worn the badges of their masters in a manner similar to the use of the
  royal badge by the Yeomen of the Guard, although sometimes the badge was
  embroidered upon the sleeve; and the wearing of the badge by the
  retainers is the chief and principal use to which badges were anciently
  put. Nisbet alludes on this point to a paragraph from the Act for the
  Order of the Riding of Parliament in 1681, which says that "the
  noblemen's lacqueys may have over their liveries velvet coats with their
  badges, <i>i.e.</i> their crests and mottoes done on plate, or
  embroidered on the back and breast conform to ancient custom." A curious
  survival of these plates is to be found in the large silver plaques worn
  by so many bank messengers. Badges appear, however, to have been
  frequently depicted semé upon the lambrequins of armorial achievements,
  as will be seen from many of the old Garter plates; but here, again, it
  is not always easy to distinguish between definite badges and artistic
  decoration, nor between actual badges in use and mere appropriately
  selected charges from the shield.</p>

  <p>The water-bougets of Lord Berners, the knot of Lord Stafford,
  popularly known as "the Stafford knot"; the Harington fret; the ragged
  staff or the bear and the ragged staff of Lord Warwick (this <!-- Page
  459 --><span class="pagenum" title="515.png"><a
  name="page459"></a>{459}</span>being really a conjunction of two separate
  devices); the Rose of England, the Thistle of Scotland, and the sledge of
  Stourton, the hemp-brake of Lord Braye wherever met with are readily
  recognised as badges, but there are many badges which it is difficult to
  distinguish from crests, and even some which in all respects would appear
  to be more correctly regarded as coats of arms.</p>

  <p>It is a point worthy of consideration whether or not a badge needs a
  background; here, again, it is a matter most difficult to determine, but
  it is singular that in any matter of <i>record</i> the badge is almost
  invariably depicted upon a background, either of a standard or a
  mantling, or upon the "field" of a roundel, and it may well be that their
  use in such circumstances as the two cases first mentioned may have only
  been considered correct when the colour of the mantling or the standard
  happened to be the right colour for the background of the badge.</p>

  <p>Badges are most usually met with in stained glass upon roundels of
  some colour or colours, and though one would hesitate to assert it as an
  actual fact, there are many instances which would lead one to suppose
  that the background of a badge was usually the livery colour or colours
  of its then owner, or of the family from which it was originally
  inherited. Certain is it that there are very few contemporary instances
  of badges which, when emblazoned, are not upon the known livery colours;
  and if this fact be accepted, then one is perhaps justified in assuming
  all to be livery colours, and we get at once a ready explanation on
  several points which have long puzzled antiquaries. The name of Edward
  "the Black Prince" has often been a matter of discussion, and the
  children's history books tell us that the nickname originated from the
  colour of his armour. This may be true enough, but as most armour would
  be black when it was unpolished, and as most armour was either polished
  or dull, the probabilities are not very greatly in its favour. Though
  there can be found instances, it was not a usual custom for any one to
  paint his armour red or green. Even if the armour of the prince were
  enamelled black it would be so usually hidden by his surcoat that he is
  hardly likely to have been nicknamed from it. It seems to me far more
  probable that black was the livery colour of the Black Prince, and that
  his own retainers and followers wore the livery of black. If that were
  the case, one understands at once how he would obtain the nickname. The
  nickname is doubtless contemporary. A curious confirmation of my
  supposition is met with in the fact that his shield for peace was:
  "Sable, three ostrich feathers two and one, the quill of each passing
  through a scroll argent." There we get the undoubted badge of the ostrich
  feather, which was originally borne singly, depicted upon his livery
  colour&mdash;black. <!-- Page 460 --><span class="pagenum" title="516.png"
  ><a name="page460"></a>{460}</span></p>

  <p>The badges represented in Prince Arthur's Book in the College of Arms
  (an important source of our knowledge upon the subject) are all upon
  backgrounds; and the curious divisions of the colours on the backgrounds
  would seem to show that each badge had its own background, several badges
  being only met with upon the same ground when that happens to be the true
  background belonging to them. But in attempting to deduce rules, it
  should be remembered that in all and every armorial matter there was
  greater laxity of rule at the period of the actual use of arms as a
  reality of life than it was possible to permit when the multiplication of
  arms as paper insignia made regulation necessary and more restrictive; so
  that an occasional variation from any deduction need not necessarily
  vitiate the conclusion, even in a matter exclusively relating to the
  shield. How much more, then, must we remain in doubt when dealing with
  badges which appear to have been so largely a matter of personal
  caprice.</p>

  <p>It is a striking comment that of all the badges presently to be
  referred to of the Stafford family, each single one is depicted upon a
  background. It is a noticeable fact that of the eighteen "badges"
  exemplified as belonging to the family of Stafford, nine are upon
  parti-coloured fields. This is not an unreasonable proportion if the
  fields are considered to be the livery colours of the families from whom
  the badges were originally derived, but it is altogether out of
  proportion to the number of shields in any roll of arms which would have
  the field party per pale, or party in any other form of division. With
  the exception of the second badge, which is on a striped background of
  green and white, all the party backgrounds are party per pale, which was
  the most usual way of depicting a livery in the few records which have
  come down to us of the heraldic use of livery colours, and of the
  eighteen badges, no less than eight are upon a parti-coloured field of
  which the dexter is sable and the sinister gules. Scarlet and black are
  known to have been the livery colours of Edward Stafford, Duke of
  Buckingham, who was beheaded in 1521. The arms of the town of Buckingham
  are on a field per pale sable and gules.</p>

  <p>With regard to the descent of badges and the laws which govern their
  descent still less is known. The answer to the question, "How did badges
  descend?" is simple: "Nobody knows." One can only hazard opinions more or
  less pious, of more or less value. It is distinctly a point upon which it
  is risky to be dogmatic, and we must wait for the development which will
  follow the recent revival of the granting of standards. As cases occur
  for decision precedents will be found and disclosed. Whilst the secrecy
  of the records of the College of Arms is so jealously preserved it is
  impossible to speak definitely at present, for an exact and comprehensive
  knowledge of exact and <!-- Page 461 --><span class="pagenum" title="517.png"
  ><a name="page461"></a>{461}</span>authoritative instances of fact is
  necessary before a decision can be definitely put forward. Unless some
  officer of arms will carefully collate the information which can be
  gleaned from the records in the College of Arms which are relevant to the
  subject, it does not seem likely that our knowledge will advance
  greatly.</p>

  <p>The grant of supporters to the Earl of Stafford, as under, is worthy
  of attention.</p>

    Stafford Howard, Earl of Stafford.</p>

  <p>It may be of interest to call attention to the fact that in this
  exemplification the Royal Arms are displayed before those of Stafford. On
  the face of it, the document&mdash;as far as it relates to the
  badges&mdash;is no more than a certificate or exemplification, in which
  case it is undoubted evidence that badges descend to the heir-general as
  do quarterings; but there is the possibility that the document is a
  re-grant in the nature of an exemplification following a Royal Licence,
  or a re-grant to remove uncertainty as to the attainder. And if the
  document&mdash;as far as its relation to the badges goes&mdash;has any of
  the character of a grant, it can have but little value as evidence of the
  descent of badges. It is remarkable that it is absolutely silent as to
  the future destination of the badges. The real fact is that the whole
  subject of the descent and devolution of badges is shrouded in mystery.
  Each of the badges (Fig. 674) is depicted within a circle adorned with a
  succession of Stafford knots, as is shown in the one instance at the
  head. Five of these badges appear upon a well-known portrait of Edward,
  Duke of Buckingham. The fact that some of these <i>badges</i> are really
  crests depicted upon wreaths goes far as an authority for the use of a
  crest upon livery buttons for the purposes of a badge.</p>

  <p>In ancient days all records seemed to point to the fact that badges
  were personal, and that though they were worn by the retainers, they were
  the property of <i>the head</i> of the family, rather than (as the arms)
  of the whole family, and though the information available is meagre to
  the last degree, it would appear probable that in all cases where their
  use by other members of the family than the head of the house can be
  proved, the likelihood is that the cadets would render feudal service and
  would wear the badge as retainers of the man whose standard they followed
  into battle, so that we should expect to find the badge following the
  same descent as the peerage, together with the lands and liabilities
  which accompanied it. This undoubtedly makes for the inheritance of a
  badge upon the same line of descent as a barony by writ, and such a
  method of inheritance accounts for the known descent of most of the
  badges heraldically familiar to us. Probably we shall be right in so
  accepting it as the ancient rule of inheritance. But, on the other hand,
  a careful examination of the "Book of Standards," now preserved in the
  College of Arms, provides several examples charged with marks of cadency.
  But here again one is in ignorance whether this is an admission of
  inheritance by cadets, or whether the cases should be considered as
  grants of differenced versions to cadets. This then gives us the badge,
  the property in and of which would descend to the heir-general (and
  perhaps also to cadets), whilst it would be used (if there were no
  inherited right) in token of allegiance or service, actual, quasi-actual,
  <!-- Page 464 --><span class="pagenum" title="520.png"><a
  name="page464"></a>{464}</span>or sentimental, by the cadets of the house
  and their servants; for whilst the use of the cockade is a survival of
  the right to be waited on and served by a soldier servant, the use of a
  badge by a cadet may be a survival and reminder of the day when (until
  they married heiresses and continued or founded other families) the
  cadets of a house owed and gave military service to the head of their own
  family, and in return were supported by him.</p>

  <p>From the wording of the recent grants of badges I believe the
  intention, however, is that the badge is to descend of right to all of
  those people on whom a right to it would devolve if it were a
  quartering.</p>

  <p>The use of badges having been so limited, the absence of rule and
  regulation leaves it very much a matter of personal taste how badges,
  where they exist, shall be heraldically depicted, and perhaps it is
  better to leave their manner of display to artistic requirements. The
  most usual place, when depicted in conjunction with an achievement, is on
  either side of the crest, and they may well be placed in that position.
  Where they exist, however, they ought undoubtedly to be continued in use
  upon the liveries of the servants, and the present practice is for them
  to be placed on the livery buttons, and embroidered upon the epaulettes
  or on the sleeves of state liveries. Undoubtedly the former practice of
  placing the badge upon the servants' livery is the precursor of the
  present vogue of placing crests upon livery buttons, and many heraldic
  writers complain of the impropriety of placing the crest in such a
  position. I am not sure that I myself may not have been guilty in this
  way; but when one bears in mind the number of cases in which the badge
  and the crest are identical, and when, as in the above instance, devices
  which are undoubtedly crests are exemplified as and termed badges, even
  as such being represented upon wreaths, and even in that form granted
  upon standards, whilst in other cases the action has been the reverse, it
  leaves one under the necessity of being careful in making definite
  assertions.</p>

  <p>Having dealt with the laws (if there ever were any) and the practice
  concerning the use and display of badges in former days, it will be of
  interest to notice some of those which were anciently in use.</p>

  <p>I have already referred to the badge of the ostrich feathers, now
  borne exclusively by the heir-apparent to the throne. The old legend that
  the Black Prince won the badge at the battle of Crecy by the capture of
  John, King of Bohemia, together with the motto "Ich dien," has been long
  since exploded. Sir Harris Nicolas brought to notice the fact that among
  certain pieces of plate belonging to Queen Philippa of Hainault was a
  large silver-gilt dish enamelled with a black escutcheon with ostrich
  feathers, "vuo scuch nigro cum pennis de <!-- Page 465 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="521.png"><a
  name="page465"></a>{465}</span>ostrich," and upon the strength of that,
  suggested that the ostrich feather was probably originally a badge of the
  Counts of Hainault derived from the County of Ostrevaus, a title which
  was held by their eldest sons. The suggestion in itself seems probable
  enough and may be correct, but it would not account for the use of the
  ostrich feathers by the Mowbray family, who did not descend from the
  marriage of Edward III. and Philippa of Hainault. Contemporary proof of
  the use of badges is often difficult to find. The Mowbrays had many
  badges, and certainly do not appear to have made any very extensive use
  of the ostrich feathers. But there seems to be very definite authority
  for the existence of the badge. There is in one of the records of the
  College of Arms (R. 22, 67), which is itself a copy of another record,
  the following statement:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The discent of Mowbray written at length in lattin from the Abby
  booke of newborough wherein Rich 2 gaue to Thomas Duke of norff. &amp;
  Erle Marshall the armes of Saint Edward Confessor in theis words:</p>

  <p>"Et dedit eidem Thome ad pertandum in sigillo et vexillo quo arma
  S<sup>ti</sup> Edwardi. Idcirco arma bipartata portavit scil' 't Sci
  Edwardi et domini marcialis angliæ cum duabus pennis strutionis erectis
  et super crestam leonem et duo parva scuta cum leonibus et utraq' parto
  predictorum armorum."</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    675.</span>&mdash;The arms granted by King Richard II. to Thomas de
    Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, and showing the ostrich feather badges.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Accompanying this is a rough-tricked sketch of the arms upon which the
  illustration (Fig. 675) has been based. Below this extract in the College
  Records is written in another hand: "I find this then <!-- Page 466
  --><span class="pagenum" title="522.png"><a
  name="page466"></a>{466}</span>in ye chancell window of Effingham by
  Bungay in the top of the cot window with Mowbraye &amp; Segrave on the
  side in glass there."</p>

  <p>Who the writer was I am unaware. He appends a further sketch to his
  note, which slightly differs. No helmet or crest is shown, and the
  central shield has only the arms of Brotherton. The feathers which flank
  it are both enfiled below the shield by one coronet. Of the smaller
  shields at the side, the dexter bears the arms of Mowbray and the
  sinister those of Segrave. Possibly the Mowbrays, as recognised members
  of the Royal Family, bore the badge by subsequent grant and authorisation
  and not on the simple basis of inheritance.</p>

  <p>An ostrich feather piercing a scroll was certainly the favourite badge
  of the Black Prince and so appears on several of his seals, and
  triplicated it occurs on his "shield of peace" (Fig. 478), which, set up
  under the instructions in his will, still remains on his monument in
  Canterbury Cathedral. The arms of Sir Roger de Clarendon, the
  illegitimate son of the Black Prince, were derived from this "shield for
  peace," which I take it was not really a coat of arms at all, but merely
  the badge of the Prince depicted upon his livery colour, and which might
  equally have been displayed upon a roundle. In the form of a shield
  bearing three feathers the badge occurs on the obverse of the second seal
  of Henry IV. in 1411. A single ostrich feather with the motto "Ich dien"
  upon the scroll is to be seen on the seal of Edward, Duke of York, who
  was killed at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. Henry IV. as Duke of
  Lancaster placed on either side of his escutcheon an ostrich feather with
  a garter or belt carrying the motto "Sovereygne" <i>twined around</i> the
  feather, John of Gaunt used the badge with a chain laid along the quill,
  and Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, used it with a garter and buckle instead
  of the chain; whilst John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, placed an ostrich
  feather on each side of his shield, the quills in his case being compony
  argent and azure, like the bordure round his arms.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    676.</span>&mdash;Seal of King James II. for the Duchy of
    Lancaster.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is a note in Harl. MS. 304, folio 12, which, if it be strictly
  accurate, is of some importance. It is to the effect that the "feather
  silver with the pen gold is the King's, the ostrich feather pen and all
  silver is the Prince's (<i>i.e.</i> the Prince of Wales), and the ostrich
  feather gold the pen ermine is the Duke of Lancaster's." That statement
  evidently relates to a time when the three were in existence
  contemporaneously, <i>i.e.</i> before the accession of Henry IV. In the
  reign of Richard II. there was no Prince of Wales. During the reign of
  Edward III. from 1376 onwards, Richard, afterwards Richard II., was
  Prince of Wales, and John of Gaunt was Duke of Lancaster (so cr. 1362).
  But John of Gaunt used the feather in the form above stated, and to find
  a Duke of Lancaster <i>before</i> John of Gaunt we must go <!-- Page 467
  --><span class="pagenum" title="525.png"><a
  name="page467"></a>{467}</span>back to before 1360, when we have Edward
  III. as King, the Black Prince as Prince, and Henry of Lancaster
  (father-in-law of John of Gaunt) as Duke of Lancaster. He derived from
  Henry III., and like the Mowbrays had no blood descent from Philippa of
  Hainault. A curious confirmation of my suggestion that black was the
  livery colour of the Black Prince is found in the fact that there was in
  a window in St. Dunstan's Church, London, within a wreath of roses a
  roundle per pale sanguine and azure (these being unquestionably livery
  colours), a plume of ostrich feathers argent, quilled or, enfiled by a
  scroll bearing the words "Ich dien." Above was the Prince's coronet and
  the letters E. &amp; P., one on each side of the plume. This was intended
  for Edward VI., doubtless being erected in the reign of Henry VIII. The
  badge in the form in which we know it, <i>i.e.</i> enfiled by the
  princely coronet, dates from about the beginning of the Stuart dynasty,
  since when it appears to have been exclusively reserved for the eldest
  son and heir-apparent to the throne. At the same time the right to the
  display of the badge would appear to have been reserved by the Sovereign,
  and Woodward remarks:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"On the Privy Seals of our Sovereigns the ostrich feather is still
  employed as a badge. The shield of arms is usually placed between two
  lions sejant guardant addorsed, each holding the feather. On the Privy
  Seal of Henry VIII. the feathers are used without the lions, and this was
  the case on the majority of the seals of the Duchy of Lancaster. On the
  reverse of the present seal of the Duchy the feathers appear to be
  ermine."</p>

  <p>Fig. 676 shows the seal of James II. for the Duchy of Lancaster. The
  seal of the Lancashire County Council shows a shield supported by two
  talbots sejant addorsed, each supporting in the exterior paw an ostrich
  feather semé-de-lis. It is possible that the talbots may be intended for
  lions and the fleurs-de-lis for ermine spots. The silver swan, one of the
  badges of King Henry V., was used also by Henry IV. It was derived from
  the De Bohuns, Mary de Bohun being the wife of Henry IV. From the De
  Bohuns it has been traced to the Mandevilles, Earls of Essex, who may
  have adopted it to typify their descent from Adam Fitz Swanne,
  <i>temp.</i> Conquest. Fig. 33 on the same plate is the white hart of
  Richard II. Although some have traced this badge from the white hind used
  as a badge by Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent, the mother of Richard II., it
  is probably a device punning upon his name, "Rich-hart." Richard II. was
  not the heir of his mother. The heir was his half-brother, Thomas Holand,
  Earl of Kent, who <i>did</i> use the badge of the hind, and perhaps the
  real truth is that the Earl of Kent having the better claim to the hind,
  Richard was under the necessity of making an alteration which the obvious
  pun upon his <!-- Page 468 --><span class="pagenum" title="526.png"><a
  name="page468"></a>{468}</span>name suggested. There is no doubt that the
  crest of Ireland originated therefrom. The stag in this case was
  undoubtedly "lodged" in the earliest versions, and I have been much
  interested in tracing the steps by which the springing attitude has
  developed owing to the copying of badly drawn examples.</p>

  <p>Amongst the many Royal and other badges in this country there are some
  of considerable interest. Fig. 677 represents the famous badge of the
  "broom-cod" or "planta genista," from which the name of the dynasty was
  derived. It appears to have been first used by King Henry II., though it
  figures in the decoration of the tomb of Geoffrey, Count of Anjou.
  "Peascod" Street in Windsor of course derives its name therefrom. The
  well-known badges of the white and red roses of York and Lancaster have
  been already referred to, and Fig. 678, the well-known device of the
  "rose-en-soliel" used by King Edward IV., was really a combination of two
  distinct badges, viz. "the blazing sun of York" and the "white rose of
  York." The rose again appears in 679, here dimidiated with the
  pomegranate of Catharine of Aragon. This is taken from the famous
  Tournament Roll (now in the College of Arms), which relates to the
  Tournament, 13th and 14th of February 1510, to celebrate the birth of
  Prince Henry.</p>

    680.</span>&mdash;Badge of Richard I.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Richard I., John, and Henry III. are all said to have used the device
  of the crescent and star (Fig. 680). Henry VII. is best known by his two
  badges of the crowned portcullis and the "sun-burst" (Fig. 681). The
  suggested origin of the former, that it was a pun on the name Tudor
  (<i>i.e.</i> two-door) is confirmed by the motto "Altera securitas" which
  was used with it, but at the same time is rather vitiated by the fact
  that it was also used by the Beauforts, who had <!-- Page 469 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="527.png"><a name="page469"></a>{469}</span>no
  Tudor descent. Save a very tentative remark hazarded by Woodward, no
  explanation has as yet been suggested for the sun-burst. My own strong
  conviction, based on the fact that this particular badge was principally
  used by Henry VII., who was always known as Henry of Windsor, is that it
  is nothing more than an attempt to pictorially represent the name
  "Windsor" by depicting "winds" of "or." The badge is also attributed to
  Edward III., and he, like Henry VII., made his principal residence at
  Windsor. Edward IV. also used the white lion of March (whence is derived
  the shield of Ludlow: "Azure, a lion couchant guardant, between three
  roses argent," Ludlow being one of the fortified towns in the Welsh
  Marches), and the black bull which, though often termed "of Clarence," is
  generally associated with the Duchy of Cornwall. Richard III., as Duke of
  Gloucester, used a white boar.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Northumberland used a silver crescent; the Earl of
  Douglas, a red hart; the Earl of Pembroke, a golden pack-horse with
  collar and traces; Lord Hastings bore as badge a black bull's head
  erased, gorged with a coronet; Lord Stanley, a golden griffin's leg,
  erased; Lord Howard, a white lion charged on the shoulder with a blue
  crescent; Sir Richard Dunstable adopted a white cock as a badge; Sir John
  Savage, a silver unicorn's head erased; Sir Simon Montford, a golden
  lily; Sir William Gresham, a green grasshopper.</p>

  <p>Two curious badges are to be seen in Figs. 682 and 683. The former is
  an ape's clog argent, chained or, and was used by William de la Pole,
  Duke of Suffolk (<i>d.</i> 1450). Fig. 683, "a salet silver" (MS. Coll.
  of Arms, 2nd M. 16), is the badge of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk
  (<i>d.</i> 1524). Various families used knots of different design, of
  which the best known is the Stafford knot (Fig. 684). The wholesale and
  improper appropriation of this badge with a territorial application has
  unfortunately caused it to be very generally referred to as a
  "Staffordshire" knot, and that it was the personal badge of the Lords
  Stafford is too often overlooked. Other badge knots are the Wake or
  Ormonde knot (Fig. 685), the Bourchier knot (Fig. 686), and the Heneage
  knot (Fig. 687).</p>

<p><!-- Page 470 --><span class="pagenum" title="528.png"><a name="page470"></a>{470}</span></p>

  <p>The personal badges of the members of the Royal Family continued in
  use until the reign of Queen Anne, but from that time forward the Royal
  badges obtained a territorial character; the rose of England, the thistle
  of Scotland, and the shamrock of Ireland. To these popular consent has
  added the lotus-flower for India, the maple for Canada, and in a lesser
  degree the wattle or mimosa for Australia; but at present these lack any
  official confirmation. The two first named, nevertheless, figured on the
  Coronation Invitation Cards. <!-- Page 471 --><span class="pagenum" title="529.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXX</h5>

<h5>HERALDIC FLAGS, BANNERS, AND STANDARDS</h5>

  <p>When it comes to the display of flags, the British-born individual
  usually makes a hash of the whole business, and flies either the
  Sovereign's personal coat of arms, which really should only be made use
  of over a residence of the Sovereign when the Sovereign is actually
  there, or flown at sea when the Sovereign is on board; or else he uses
  the national flag, colloquially termed the "Union Jack," which, strictly
  speaking, and as a matter of law, ought never to be made use of on land
  except over the residence of the Sovereign in his absence, or on a
  fortress or other Government building. But recently an official answer
  has been given in Parliament, declaring what is presumably the pleasure
  of His Majesty to the effect that the Union Jack is the National Flag,
  and may be flown as such on land by any British subject. If this is the
  intention of the Crown, it is a pity that this permission has not been
  embodied in a Royal warrant.</p>

  <p>The banner of St. George, which is a white flag with a plain red cross
  of St. George throughout, is now appropriated to the Order of the Garter,
  of which St. George is the patron saint, though I am by no means inclined
  to assert that it would be incorrect to make use of it upon a church
  which happened to be specifically placed under the patronage of St.
  George.</p>

  <p>The white ensign, which is a white flag bearing the cross of St.
  George and in the upper quarter next to the staff a reproduction of the
  Union device, belongs to the Royal Navy, and certain privileged
  individuals to whom the right has been given by a specific warrant. The
  blue ensign, which is a plain blue flag with the Union device on a canton
  in the upper corner next the staff, belongs to the Royal Naval Reserve;
  and the red ensign, which is the same as the former, except that a red
  flag is substituted for the blue one, belongs to the ships of the
  merchant service. These three flags have been specifically called into
  being by specific warrants for certain purposes which are stated in these
  warrants, and these purposes being wholly connected with the sea, neither
  the blue, the red, nor the white ensign ought to be hoisted on land by
  anybody. Of course there is no penalty for doing so on <!-- Page 472
  --><span class="pagenum" title="530.png"><a
  name="page472"></a>{472}</span>land, though very drastic penalties can be
  enforced for misuse of these ensigns on the water, a step which is taken
  frequently enough. For a private person to use any one of these three
  flags on land for a private purpose, the only analogy which I can suggest
  to bring home to people the absurdity of such action would be to instance
  a private person for his own private pleasure adopting the exact uniform
  of some regiment whenever he might feel inclined to go bathing in the
  sea. If he were to do so, he would find under the recent Act that he had
  incurred the penalty, which would be promptly enforced, for bringing His
  Majesty's uniform into disrepute. It is much to be wished that the
  penalties exacted for the wrongful display of these flags at sea should
  be extended to their abuse on shore.</p>

  <p>The development of the Union Jack and the warrants relating to it are
  dealt with herein by the Rev. J. R. Crawford, M.A., in a subsequent
  chapter, and I do not propose to further deal with the point, except to
  draw attention to a proposal, which is very often mooted, that some
  change or addition to the Union Jack should be made to typify the
  inclusion of the colonies.</p>

  <p>But to begin with, what is the Union Jack? Probably most would be
  inclined to answer, "The flag of the Empire." It is nothing of the kind.
  It is in a way stretching the definition to describe it as the King's
  flag. Certainly the design of interlaced crosses is a badge of the
  King's, but that badge is of a later origin than the flag.</p>

  <p>The flag itself is the fighting emblem of the Sovereign, which the
  Sovereign has declared shall be used by his soldiers or sailors for
  fighting purposes under certain specified circumstances. That it is used,
  even officially, in all sorts of circumstances with which the King's
  warrants are not concerned is beside the matter, for it is to the Royal
  Warrants that one must refer for the theory of the thing.</p>

  <p>Now let us go further back, and trace the "argent, a cross gules," the
  part which is England's contribution to the Union Jack, which itself is a
  combination of the "crosses" of St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick.
  The theory of one is the theory of the three, separately or
  conjoined.</p>

  <p>"Argent, a cross gules" was never the coat of arms of England (except
  under the Commonwealth, when its use for armorial purposes may certainly
  be disregarded), and the reason it came to be regarded as the flag of
  England is simply and solely because fighting was always done under the
  supposed patronage of some saint, and England fought, <i>not</i> under
  the arms of England, but under the flag of St. George, the patron saint
  of England and of the Order of the Garter. The battle-cry "St. George for
  Merrie England!" is too well known to need more than the passing mention.
  Scotland fought under St. Andrew; Ireland, by a similar analogy, had for
  its patron saint St. Patrick (if <!-- Page 473 --><span class="pagenum" title="531.png"
  ><a name="page473"></a>{473}</span>indeed there was a Cross of St.
  Patrick before one was needed for the Union flag, which is a very
  doubtful point), and the Union Jack was not the combination of three
  territorial flags, but the combination of the recognised emblems of the
  three recognised saints, and though England claimed the sovereignty of
  France, and for that reason quartered the arms of France, no Englishman
  bothered about the patronage of St. Denis, and the emblem of St. Denis
  was never flown in this country. The fact that no change was ever made in
  the flag to typify Hanover, whilst Hanover duly had its place upon the
  arms, proves that the flag was recognised to be, and allowed to remain,
  the emblem of the three patron saints under whose patronage the British
  fought, and not the badge of any sovereignty or territorial area. If the
  colonies had already any saint of their own under whose patronage they
  had fought in bygone days, or in whose name they wished to fight in the
  future, there might be reason <i>for including the emblem of that
  saint</i> upon the fighting flag of the Empire; but they have no
  recognised saintly patrons, and they may just as well fight for our
  saints as choose others for themselves at so late a day; but having a
  flag which is a <i>combination</i> of the emblems of three saints, and
  which contains nothing that is not a part of those emblems, to make any
  addition heraldic or otherwise to it now would, in my opinion, be best
  expressed by the following illustration. Imagine three soldiers in full
  and complete uniform, one English, one Scottish, and one Irish, it being
  desired to evolve a uniform that should be taken from all three for use
  by a Union regiment. A tunic from one, trousers from another, and a
  helmet from a third, might be blended into a very effective and
  harmonious composite uniform. Following the analogy of putting a bordure,
  which is not the emblem of a saint, round the recognised emblems of the
  three recognised saints, and considering it to be in keeping because the
  bordure was heraldic and the emblems heraldic, one might argue, that
  because a uniform was clothing as was also a ballet-dancer's skirt,
  therefore a ballet-dancer's skirt outside the whole would be in keeping
  with the rest of the uniform. For myself I should dislike any addition to
  the Union device, as much as we should deride the donning of tulle skirts
  outside their tunics and trousers by the brigade of Guards.</p>

  <p>The flag which should float from a church tower should have no more on
  it than the recognised ecclesiastical emblems of the saint to whom it is
  dedicated: the keys of St. Peter, the wheel of St. Catherine, the sword
  of St. Paul, the cross and martlets of St. Edmund, the lily of St. Mary,
  the emblem of the Holy Trinity, or whatever the emblem may be of the
  saint in question. (The alternative for a church is the banner of St.
  George, the patron saint of the realm.) The flags upon public buildings
  should bear the arms of the corporate bodies to whom those <!-- Page 474
  --><span class="pagenum" title="532.png"><a
  name="page474"></a>{474}</span>buildings belong. The flag to be flown by
  a private person, as the law now stands, should bear that person's
  private arms, if he has any, and if he has not he should be content to
  forego the pleasures arising from the use of bunting. A private flag
  should be double its height in length. The entire surface should be
  occupied by the coat of arms.</p>

  <p>These flags of arms are <i>banners</i>, and it is quite a misnomer to
  term the banner of the Royal Arms the Royal Standard. The flags of arms
  hung over the stalls of the Knights of the Garter, St. Patrick, and the
  former Knights of the Bath are properly, and are always termed
  <i>banners</i>. The term <i>standard</i> properly refers to the long
  tapering flag used in battle, and under which an overlord mustered his
  retainers in battle. This did <i>not</i> display his armorial bearings.
  Next to the staff usually came the cross of St. George, which was
  depicted, of course, on a white field. This occupied rather less than
  one-third of the standard. The remainder of the standard was of the
  colour or colours of the livery, and thereupon was represented all sorts
  of devices, usually the badges and sometimes the crest. The motto was
  usually on transverse bands, which frequently divided the standard into
  compartments for the different badges. These mottoes from their nature
  are <i>not</i> war-cries, but undoubtedly relate and belong to the badges
  with which they appear in conjunction. The whole banner was usually
  fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of a bordure compony.
  The use of standards does not seem, except for the ceremonial purposes of
  funerals, to have survived the Tudor period, this doubtless being the
  result of the creation of the standing army in the reign of Henry VIII.
  The few exotic standards, <i>e.g.</i>, remaining from the Jacobite
  rebellion, seldom conform to the old patterns, but although the shape is
  altered, the artistic character largely remains in the regimental colours
  of the present day with their assorted regimental badges and scrolls with
  the names of battle honours.</p>

  <p>With the recent revival of the granting of badges the standard has
  again been brought into use as the vehicle to carry the badge (Plate
  VIII.). The arms are now placed next the staff, and upon the rest of the
  field the badge is repeated or alternated with the crest. Badges and
  standards are now granted to any person already possessing a right to
  arms and willing to pay the necessary fees.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The armorial use of the banner in connection with the display of
  heraldic achievements is very limited in this country. In the case of the
  Marquess of Dufferin and Ava the banner or flag is an integral and
  unchangeable part of the heraldic supporters, and in Ross-of-Bladensburg,
  <i>e.g.</i>, it is similarly an integral part of the crest. In the
  warrant of augmentation granted to H.M. Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain
  on her marriage, banners of the Royal Arms of <!-- Page 475 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="535.png"><a name="page475"></a>{475}</span>England
  were placed in the paws of her supporters. Other cases where arms have
  been depicted on banners are generally no more than matters of artistic
  design; but in the arms of Scotland as matriculated in Lyon Register for
  King Charles II. the supporters are accompanied by banners, the dexter
  being of the arms of Scotland, and the sinister the banner of St. Andrew.
  These banners possess rather a different character, and approach very
  closely to the German use. The same practice has been followed in the
  seals of the Duchy of Lancaster, inasmuch as on the obverse of the seal
  of George IV. and the seal of Queen Victoria the Royal supporters hold
  banners of the arms of England and of the Duchy (<i>i.e.</i> England, a
  label for difference). James I. on his Great Seal had the banners of
  Cadwallader (azure, a cross patté fitché or) and King Edgar (azure, a
  cross patonce between four martlets or), and on the Great Seal of Charles
  I. the dexter supporter holds a banner of St. George, and the sinister a
  banner of St. Andrew.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Of the heraldic use of the banner in Germany Ströhl writes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The banner appears in a coat of arms, either in the hands or paws of
  the supporters (Fig. 688), also set up behind the shield, or the
  pavilion, as, for instance, in the larger achievement of his Majesty the
  German Emperor, in the large achievement of the kingdom of Prussia, of
  the dukedom of Saxe-Altenburg, and further in the Arms of State of Italy,
  Russia, Roumania, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"Banners on the shield as charges, or on the helmet as a crest, are
  here, of course, not in question, but only those banners which serve as
  <i>Prachtstücke</i> (appendages of magnificence).</p>

  <p>"The banners of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are long and
  narrow, and frequently run in stripes, like battlements. However, in <!--
  Page 476 --><span class="pagenum" title="536.png"><a
  name="page476"></a>{476}</span>the second half of the thirteenth century
  flags were also to be met with, with the longer side attached to the
  stick. Later on the banners became more square, and show on the top a
  long strip, generally of another colour, the <i>Schwenkel</i>
  (<i>i.e.</i> something that flourishes), waves to and fro. To bear a red
  <i>Schwenkel</i> was a special privilege, similar to the right of sealing
  with red wax.</p>

  <p>"The ecclesiastical banner has three points, and is provided with
  rings on the top in order that it may be fastened to the stick by them,
  in an oblique position.</p>

  <p>"The banner always represents the field of the shield, and assumes
  accordingly its tincture. The charges of the shield should be placed upon
  the banner without the outline of a shield, and the edge against the
  flag-staff is considered the dexter; it follows from this that the figure
  must be turned towards it.</p>

  <p>"For instance, if the shield bear the following arms, argent an eagle
  gules, the same figure, suited to the size of the flag, appears on the
  banner, with its head turned towards the staff. If it be wished to
  represent only the <i>colours</i> of the arms upon the flag, that of the
  charge is placed above, and that of the field below. Thus, for example,
  the Prussian flag is black and white, corresponding to the black eagle on
  the silver field; the flag of Hohenzollern is white and black,
  corresponding to their coat of arms, quartered silver and black, because
  in the latter case, so soon as a heraldic representation is available,
  from the position of the coloured fields, the correct order of the
  tinctures is determined." <!-- Page 477 --><span class="pagenum" title="537.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXI</h5>

<h5>MARKS OF CADENCY</h5>

  <p>The manner in which cadency is indicated in heraldic emblazonment
  forms one of the most important parts of British armory, but our own
  intricate and minutely detailed systems are a purely British development
  of armory. I do not intend by the foregoing remark to assert that the
  occasional use, or even, as in some cases, the constant use of altered
  arms for purposes of indicating cadency is unknown on the Continent,
  because different branches of one family are constantly found using, for
  the purposes of distinction, variations of the arms appertaining to the
  head of their house; in France especially the bordure has been
  extensively used, but the fact nevertheless remains that in no other
  countries is there found an organised system or set of rules for the
  purpose. Nor is this idea of the indication of cadency wholly a modern
  development, though some, in fact most, of the rules presently in force
  are no doubt a result of modern requirements, and do not date back to the
  earliest periods of heraldry in this country.</p>

  <p>The obligation of cadet lines to difference their arms was recognised
  practically universally in the fourteenth century; and when, later, the
  systematic use of differencing seemed in danger of being ignored, it was
  made the subject of specific legislation. In the treatise of <span
  class="sc">Zyp&oelig;us</span>, <i>de Notitia juris Belgici</i>, lib.
  xii., quoted also in <span class="sc">Menetrier</span>, <i>Recherches du
  Blazon</i>, p. 218, we find the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ut secundo et ulterius geniti, quinimo primogeniti vivo patre,
  integra insignia non gerant, sed aliqua nota distincta, ut perpetuo linæ
  dignosci possint, et ex qua quique descendant, donec anteriores
  defecerint. Exceptis Luxenburgis et Gueldris, quibus non sunt ii mores."
  (The exception is curious.)</p>

  <p>The choice of these <i>brisures</i>, as marks of difference are often
  termed, was, however, left to the persons concerned; and there is,
  consequently, a great variety of differences or differentiation marks
  which seem to have been used for the purpose. The term "brisure" is
  really French, whilst the German term for these marks is
  "Beizeichen."</p>

  <p>British heraldry, on the contrary, is remarkable for its use of two
  <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum" title="538.png"><a
  name="page478"></a>{478}</span>distinct sets of rules&mdash;the English
  and the Scottish&mdash;the Irish system being identical with the
  former.</p>

  <p>To understand the question of cadency it is necessary to revert to the
  status of a coat of arms in early periods. In the first chapter we dealt
  with the origin of armory; and in a subsequent chapter with the status of
  a coat of arms in Great Britain, and it will therefrom have been apparent
  that arms, and a right to them, developed in this country as an adjunct
  of, or contemporaneously with, the extension of the feudal system. Every
  landowner was at one time required to have his seal&mdash;presumably, of
  arms&mdash;and as a result arms were naturally then considered to possess
  something of a territorial character. I do not by this mean to say that
  the arms belonged to the land and were transferable with the sale and
  purchase thereof. There never was in this country a period at which such
  an idea held; nor were arms originally entirely personal or individual.
  They belonged rather to a position half-way between the two. They were
  the arms of a given family, originating because that family held land and
  accepted the consequent responsibilities thereto belonging, but the arms
  appertained for the time being to the member of that family who owned the
  land, and that this is the true idea of the former status of a coat of
  arms is perhaps best evidenced by the Grey and Hastings controversy,
  which engaged the attention of the Court of Chivalry for several years
  prior to 1410. The decision and judgment in the case gave the
  undifferenced arms of Hastings to the heir-general (Grey de Ruthyn), the
  heir-male (Sir Edward Hastings) being found only capable of bearing the
  arms of Hastings subject to some mark of difference.</p>

  <p>This case, and the case of Scrope and Grosvenor, in which the king's
  award was that the bordure was not sufficient difference for a stranger
  in blood, being only the mark of a cadet, show clearly that the status of
  a coat of arms in early times was that in its undifferenced state it
  belonged to one person only for the time being, and that person the head
  of the family, though it should be noted that the term "Head of the
  Family" seems to have been interpreted into the one who held the lands of
  the family&mdash;whether he were heir-male or heir-general being
  apparently immaterial.</p>

  <p>This much being recognised, it follows that some means were needed to
  be devised to differentiate the armorial bearings of the younger members
  of the family. Of course the earliest definite instances of any attempt
  at a systematic "differencing" for cadency which can be referred to are
  undoubtedly those cases presented by the arms of the younger members of
  the Royal Family in England. These cases, however, it is impossible to
  take as precedents. Royal Arms have always, from the very earliest times,
  been a law unto themselves, <!-- Page 479 --><span class="pagenum" title="539.png"
  ><a name="page479"></a>{479}</span>subject only to the will of the
  Sovereign, and it is neither safe nor correct to deduce precedents to be
  applied to the arms of subjects from proved instances concerning the
  Royal Arms.</p>

  <p>Probably, apart from these, the earliest mark of cadency which is to
  be met with in heraldry is the label (Fig. 689) used to indicate the
  eldest son, and this mark of difference dates back far beyond any other
  regularised methods applicable to "younger" sons. The German name for the
  label is "Turnierkragen," <i>i.e.</i> Tournament Collar, which may
  indicate the origin of this curious figure. Probably the use of the label
  can be taken back to the middle or early part of the thirteenth century,
  but the opportunity and necessity of marking the arms of the
  heir-apparent temporarily, he having the expectation of eventually
  succeeding to the undifferenced arms, is a very different matter to the
  other opportunities for the use of marks of cadency. The lord and his
  heir were the two most important members of the family, and all others
  sunk their identity in their position in the household of their chief
  unless they were established by marriage, or otherwise, in lordships of
  their own, in which cases they are usually found to have preferred the
  arms of the family from whom they inherited the lordships they enjoyed;
  and their identities being to such a large extent overlooked, the
  necessity for any system of marking the arms of a younger son was not so
  early apparent as the necessity for marking the arms of the heir.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    689.</span>&mdash;The label.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The label does not appear to have been originally confined exclusively
  to the heir. It was at first the only method of differencing known, and
  it is not therefore to be wondered at that we find that it was frequently
  used by other cadets, who used it with no other meaning than to indicate
  that they were not the Head of the House. It has, consequently, in some
  few cases [for example, in the arms of Courtenay (Fig. 246), Babington,
  and Barrington] become stereotyped as a charge, and is continuously and
  unchangeably used as such, whereas doubtless it may have been no more
  originally than a mere mark of cadency. The label was originally drawn
  with its upper edge identical with the top of the shield (Fig. 520), but
  later its position on the shield was lowered. The number of points on the
  label was at first without meaning, a five-pointed label occurring in
  Fig. 690 and a seven-pointed one in Fig. 235.</p>

  <p>In the Roll of Caerlaverock the label is repeatedly referred to. Of
  Sir <span class="sc">Maurice de Berkeley</span> it is expressly declared
  that</p>

  <div class="contents">

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 480 --><span class="pagenum" title="540.png"><a name="page480"></a>{480}</span></p>

  <p>Sir <span class="sc">Patrick Dunbar</span>, son of the Earl of <span
  class="sc">Lothian</span> (<i>i.e.</i> of <span class="sc">March</span>),
  then bore arms similar to his father, with the addition of a label
  "azure." On the other hand, Sir <span class="sc">John de Segrave</span>
  is said to bear his deceased father's arms undifferenced, while his
  younger brother <span class="sc">Nicholas</span> carries them with a
  label "gules"; and in the case of <span class="sc">Edmund de
  Hastings</span> the label is also assigned to a younger brother. Further
  proof of its being thus borne by cadets is furnished by the evidence in
  the <span class="sc">Grey</span> and <span class="sc">Hastings</span>
  controversy in the reign of <span class="sc">Henry IV.</span>, from which
  it appeared that the younger line of the <span class="sc">Hastings</span>
  family had for generations differenced the paternal coat by a label of
  three points; and, as various knights and esquires had deposed to this
  label being the cognisance of the nearest heir, it was argued that the
  defendant's ancestors would not have borne their arms in this way had
  they not been the reputed next heirs of the family of the Earl of <span
  class="sc">Pembroke</span>. The label will be seen in Figs. 690, 691, and
  692, though its occurrence in the last case in each of the quarters is
  most unusual. The argent label on the arms for the Sovereignty of Man is
  a curious confirmation of the reservation of an argent label for
  Royalty.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Jane Fentoun</span>, daughter and heir-apparent of
  <span class="sc">Walter Fentoun</span> of Baikie, bore a label in 1448,
  and dropped it after her father's death. This is apparently an instance
  quite unique. I know of no other case where the label has been used by a
  woman as a mark of difference.</p>

  <p>In <span class="sc">France</span> the label was the chief recognised
  mode of difference, though the bend and the bordure are frequently to be
  met with.</p>

  <p>In <span class="sc">Germany</span>, <span class="sc">Spener</span>
  tells us that the use of the label, though occasional, was not
  infrequent: "Sicuti in Gallia vix alius discerniculorum modus frequentior
  est, ita rariora exempla reperimus in Germania," and he gives a few
  examples, though he is unable to assign the reason for its assumption as
  a hereditary bearing. The most usual method of differencing in Germany
  was by the alteration of the tinctures or by the alteration of the
  charges. As an example of the former method, the arms of the Bavarian
  family of Parteneck may be instanced (Figs. 693 to 697), all representing
  the arms of different branches of the same family.</p>

  <p>Next to the use of the label in British heraldry came the use of the
  bordure, and the latter as a mark of cadency can at any rate be traced
  back <i>as a well-established matter of rule</i> and precedent as far as
  the Scrope and Grosvenor controversy in the closing years of the
  fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>At the period when the bordure as a difference is to be most
  frequently met with in English heraldry, it never had any more definite
  status or meaning than a sign that the bearer was <i>not</i> the head of
  the house, though one cannot but think that in many cases in which it
  occurs its significance is a doubt as to legitimate descent, or a doubt
  of the probability of an asserted descent. In modern <i>English</i>
  practice the bordure as a difference for cadets only continues to be used
  by those whose ancestors bore it in ancient times. Its other use as a
  modern mark of illegitimacy is dealt with in the chapter upon marks of
  illegitimacy, but the curious and unique <i>Scottish</i> system of
  cadency bordures will be presently referred to.</p>

  <p>In Germany of old the use of the bordure as a difference does not
  appear to have been very frequent, but it is now used to distinguish <!--
  Page 482 --><span class="pagenum" title="542.png"><a
  name="page482"></a>{482}</span>the arms of the Crown Prince. In Italian
  heraldry, although differences are known, there is no system whatever. In
  Spain and Portugal marks of cadency, in our sense of the word, are almost
  unknown, but nevertheless the bordure, especially as indicating descent
  from a maternal ancestor, is very largely employed. The most familiar
  instance is afforded by the Royal Arms of Portugal, in which the arms of
  <span class="sc">Portugal</span> are surrounded by a "bordure" of <span
  class="sc">Castile</span>.</p>

  <p>Differencing, however, had become a necessity at an earlier period
  than the period at which we find an approach to the systematic usage of
  the label, bordure, and bend, but it should be noticed that those who
  wished, and needed, to difference were those younger members of the
  family who by settlement, or marriage, had themselves become lords of
  other estates, and heads of distinct houses. For a man must be taken as a
  "Head of a House" for all intents and purposes as soon as by his
  possession of lands "held in chief" he became <i>himself</i> liable to
  the Crown to provide stated military service, and as a consequence found
  the necessity for a banner of arms, under which his men could be
  mustered. Now having these positions as overlords, the inducement was
  rather to set up arms for themselves than to pose merely as cadets of
  other families, and there can be no doubt whatever that at the earliest
  period, differencing, for the above reason, took the form of and was
  meant as a <i>change in the arms</i>. It was something quite beyond and
  apart from the mere condition of a right to recognised arms, with an
  indication thereupon that the bearer was not the person chiefly entitled
  to the display of that particular coat. We therefore find cadets bearing
  the arms of their house with the tincture changed, with subsidiary
  charges introduced, or with some similar radical alteration made. Such
  coats should properly be considered essentially <i>different</i> coats,
  merely <i>indicating</i> in their design a given relationship rather than
  as the <i>same</i> coat regularly differenced by rule to indicate
  cadency. For instance, the three original branches of the Conyers family
  bear: "Azure, a maunch ermine; azure, a maunch or; azure, a maunch ermine
  debruised by a bendlet gules." The coat differenced by the bend, of
  course, stands self-confessed as a differenced coat, but it is by no
  means certain, nor is it known whether "azure, a maunch ermine," or
  "azure, a maunch or" indicates the original Conyers arms, for the very
  simple reason that it is now impossible to definitely prove which branch
  supplies the true head of the family. It is known that a wicked uncle
  intervened, and usurped the estates to the detriment of the nephew and
  heir, but whether the uncle usurped the arms with the estates, or whether
  the heir changed his arms when settled on the other lands to which he
  migrated, there is now no means of ascertaining.</p>

  <p>Similarly we find the Darcy arms ["Argent, three cinquefoils gules,"
  <!-- Page 483 --><span class="pagenum" title="543.png"><a
  name="page483"></a>{483}</span>which is probably the oldest form],
  "Argent, crusuly and three cinquefoils gules," and "Azure, crusuly and
  three cinquefoils argent," and countless instances can be referred to
  where, for the purpose of indicating cadency, the arms of a family were
  changed in this manner. This reason, of which there can be no doubt,
  supplies the origin and the excuse for the custom of assigning
  <i>similar</i> arms when the descent is but doubtful. Similarity
  originally, though it <i>may</i> indicate consanguinity, was never
  intended to be proof thereof.</p>

  <p>The principal ancient methods of alteration in arms, which nowadays
  are apparently accepted as former modes of differencing merely to
  indicate cadency, may perhaps be classified into: (<i>a</i>) Change of
  tincture; (<i>b</i>) the addition of small charges to the field, or to an
  ordinary; (<i>c</i>) the addition of a label or (<i>d</i>) of a canton or
  quarter; (<i>e</i>) the addition of an inescutcheon; (<i>f</i>) the
  addition (or change) of an ordinary; (<i>g</i>) the changing of the lines
  of partition enclosing an ordinary, and perhaps also (<i>h</i>)
  diminishing the number of charges; (<i>i</i>) a change of some or all of
  the minor charges. At a later date came (<i>j</i>) the systematic use of
  the label, the bordure, and the bend; and subsequently (<i>k</i>) the use
  of the modern systems of "marks of cadency." Perhaps, also, one should
  include (<i>l</i>) the addition of quarterings, the use of (<i>m</i>)
  augmentations and official arms, and (<i>n</i>) the escutcheon <i>en
  surtout</i>, indicating a territorial and titular lordship, but the three
  last-mentioned, though useful for distinction and frequently obviating
  the necessity of other marks of cadency, did not originate with the
  theory or necessities of differencing, and are not properly marks of
  cadency. At the same time, the warning should be given that it is not
  safe always to presume cadency when a change of tincture or other slight
  deviation from an earlier form of the arms is met with. Many families
  when they exhibited their arms at the Visitations could not substantiate
  them, and the heralds, in confirming arms, frequently deliberately
  changed the tinctures of many coats they met with, to introduce
  distinction from other authorised arms.</p>

  <p>Practically contemporarily with the use of the bordure came the use of
  the bend, then employed for the same purpose. In the <i>Armorial de
  Gelre</i>, one of the earliest armorials now in existence which can be
  referred to, the well-known coat of Abernethy is there differenced by the
  bendlet engrailed, and the arms of the King of Navarre bear his
  quartering of France differenced by a bendlet compony. Amongst other
  instances in which the bend or bendlet appears originally as a mark of
  cadency, but now as a charge, may be mentioned the arms of Fitzherbert,
  Fulton, Stewart (Earl of Galloway), and others. It is a safe presumption
  with regard to ancient coats of arms that any coat in which the field is
  semé is in nine cases out of ten a differenced coat <!-- Page 484
  --><span class="pagenum" title="544.png"><a
  name="page484"></a>{484}</span>for a junior cadet, as is also any coat in
  which a charge or ordinary is debruised by another. Of course in more
  modern times no such presumption is permissible. An instance of a semé
  field for cadency will be found in the case of the D'Arcy arms already
  mentioned. Little would be gained by a long list of instances of such
  differences, because the most careful and systematic investigations
  clearly show that in early times no definite rules whatever existed as to
  the assumption of differences, which largely depended upon the pleasure
  of the bearer, and no system can be deduced which can be used to decide
  that the appearance of any given difference or kind of difference meant a
  given set of circumstances. Nor can any system be deduced which has any
  value for the purposes of precedent.</p>

  <p>Certain instances are appended which will indicate the style of
  differencing which was in vogue, but it should be distinctly remembered
  that the object was not to allocate the bearer of any particular coat of
  arms to any specific place in the family pedigree, but merely to show
  that he was not the head of the house, entitled to bear the undifferenced
  arms, if indeed it would not be more accurate to describe these instances
  as simply examples of different coats of arms used by members of the same
  family. For it should be remembered that anciently, before the days of
  "black and white" illustration, prominent change of tincture was
  admittedly a sufficient distinction between strangers in blood. Beyond
  the use of the label and the bordure there does not seem to have been any
  recognised system of differencing until at the earliest the fifteenth
  century&mdash;probably any regulated system does not date much beyond the
  commencement of the series of Visitations.</p>

  <p>Of the four sons of <span class="sc">Gilles De Mailly</span>, who
  bore, "Or, three mallets vert," the second, third, and fourth sons
  respectively made the charges "gules," "azure," and "sable." The "argent"
  field of the <span class="sc">Douglas</span> coat was in some branches
  converted into "ermine" as early as 1373; and the descendants of the
  <span class="sc">Douglases</span> of Dalkeith made the chief "gules"
  instead of "azure." A similar mode of differencing occurs in the Lyon
  Register in many other families. The <span class="sc">Murrays</span> of
  Culbin in the North bore a "sable" field for their arms in lieu of the
  more usual "azure," and there seems reason to believe that the Southern
  Frasers originally bore their field "sable," the change to "azure" being
  an alteration made by those branches who migrated northwards. An
  interesting series of arms is met with in the case of the differences
  employed by the Earls of Warwick. Waleran, Earl of Warwick (<i>d.</i>
  1204), appears to have added to the arms of Warenne (his mother's family)
  "a chevron ermine." His son Henry, Earl of Warwick (<i>d.</i> 1229),
  changed the chevron to a bend, but Thomas, Earl <!-- Page 485 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="545.png"><a name="page485"></a>{485}</span>of
  Warwick (<i>d.</i> 1242), reverted to the chevron, a form which was
  perpetuated after the earldom had passed to the house of Beauchamp. An
  instance of the addition of mullets to the bend in the arms of Bohun is
  met with in the cadet line created Earls of Northampton.</p>

  <p>The shield of <span class="sc">William de Roumare</span>, Earl of
  <span class="sc">Lincoln</span>, who died in 1198, is adduced by Mr.
  <span class="sc">Planché</span> as an early example of differencing by
  crosses crosslet; the principal charges being seven mascles conjoined,
  three, three, and one. We find in the Rolls of Arms of the thirteenth and
  early part of the fourteenth century many instances of coats crusily,
  billetty, bezanty, and "pleyn d'escallops," fleurette, and "a les
  trefoiles d'or." With these last Sir <span class="sc">Edmond Dacre</span>
  of Westmoreland powdered the shield borne by the head of his family:
  "Gules, three escallops or" (Roll of Edward II.). The coat borne by the
  <span class="sc">Actons</span> of Aldenham, "Gules, crusily or, two lions
  passant argent," is sometimes quoted as a gerated coat of <span
  class="sc">Lestrange</span>; for <span class="sc">Edward de Acton</span>
  married the coheiress of <span class="sc">Lestrange</span> (living 1387),
  who bore simply: "Gules, two lions passant argent." That the arms of
  Acton are derived from Lestrange cannot be questioned, but the
  probability is that they were <i>a new invention</i> as a distinct coat,
  the charges suggested by Lestrange. The original coat of the House of
  Berkeley in England (Barclay in Scotland) appears to have been: "Gules, a
  chevron or" (or "argent"). The seals of <span class="sc">Robert de
  Berkeley</span>, who died 4 Henry III., and <span class="sc">Maurice de
  Berkeley</span>, who died 1281, all show the shield charged with a
  chevron only. <span class="sc">Moris de Barkele</span>, in the Roll
  <i>temp.</i> Henry III., bears: "Goules, a chevron argent."</p>

  <p>But <span class="sc">Thomas</span>, son of <span
  class="sc">Maurice</span>, who died 15 <span class="sc">Edward
  II.</span>, has the present coat: "Gules, a chevron between ten crosses
  patée argent;" while in the roll of Edward II., "De goules od les
  rosettes de argent et un chevron de argent" is attributed to Sir <span
  class="sc">Thomas de Berkeley</span>. In Leicestershire the <span
  class="sc">Berkeleys</span> gerated with cinquefoils, an ancient and
  favourite bearing in that county, derived of course from the arms or
  badge of the Earl of Leicester. In Scotland the <span
  class="sc">Barclays</span> differenced by change of tincture, and bore:
  "Azure, a chevron argent between (or in chief) three crosses patée of the
  same." An interesting series of differences is met with upon the arms of
  <span class="sc">Neville</span> of Raby, which are: "Gules, a saltire
  argent," and which were differenced by a crescent "sable"; a martlet
  "gules"; a mullet "sable" and a mullet "azure"; a "fleur-de-lis"; a rose
  "gules"; a pellet, or annulet, "sable," this being the difference of Lord
  Latimer; and two interlaced annulets "azure," all borne on the centre
  point of the saltire. The interlaced annulets were borne by Lord Montagu,
  as a <i>second</i> difference on the arms of his father, Richard Nevill,
  Earl of Salisbury, he and his brother the King-maker <i>both</i> using
  the curious <!-- Page 486 --><span class="pagenum" title="546.png"><a
  name="page486"></a>{486}</span>compony label of azure and argent borne by
  their father, which indicated their descent from John of Gaunt. One of
  the best known English examples of differencing by a change of charges is
  that of the coat of the <span class="sc">Cobhams</span>, "Gules, a
  chevron or," in which the ordinary was charged by various cadets with
  three pierced estoiles, three lions, three crossed crosslets, three
  "fleurs-de-lis," three crescents, and three martlets, all of "sable."</p>

  <p>The original <span class="sc">Grey</span> coat ["Barry of six argent
  and azure"] is differenced in the Roll of Edward I. by a bend gules for
  <span class="sc">John de Grey</span>; at Caerlaverock this is
  engrailed.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Segrave</span> coat ["Sable, a lion rampant
  argent"] is differenced by the addition of "a bendlet or"; or "a bendlet
  gules"; and the last is again differenced by engrailing it.</p>

  <p>In the Calais Roll the arms of <span class="sc">William de
  Warren</span> ["Chequy or and azure"] are differenced by the addition of
  a canton said to be that of <span class="sc">Fitzalan</span> (but really
  that of <span class="sc">Nerford</span>).</p>

  <p>Whilst no regular system of differencing has survived in France, and
  whilst outside the Royal Family arms in that country show comparatively
  few examples of difference marks, the system as regards the French Royal
  Arms was well observed and approximated closely to our own. The Dauphin
  of France bore the Royal Arms undifferenced but never alone, they being
  always quartered with the sovereign arms of his personal sovereignty of
  Dauphiné: "Or, a dolphin embowed azure, finned gules." This has been more
  fully referred to on page 254. It is much to be regretted that the arms
  of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales do not include the arms of his sovereignty
  of the Duchy of Cornwall, nor any allusion to his dignities of Prince of
  Wales or Earl of Chester.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    698.</span>&mdash;Seal of Elizabeth, widow of Philip, Duke of
    Orleans.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The arms of the Dukes of Orleans were the arms of France differenced
  by a label argent. This is to be observed, for example, upon the seal
  (Fig. 698) of the Duchess Charlotte Elizabeth of Orleans, widow of Philip
  of Orleans, brother of King Louis XIV. of France. She was a daughter of
  the Elector Charles Louis. The arms of the old Dukes of Anjou were the
  ancient coat of France (azure, semé-de-lis or) differenced by a label of
  five points gules, but the younger house <!-- Page 487 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="547.png"><a name="page487"></a>{487}</span>of
  Anjou bore the modern arms of France differenced by a bordure gules. The
  Dukes d'Alençon also used the bordure gules, but charged this with eight
  plates, whilst the Dukes de Berri used a bordure <i>engrailed</i>
  gules.</p>

  <p>The Counts d'Angoulême used the arms of the Dukes of Orleans, adding a
  crescent gules on each point of the label, whilst the Counts d'Artois
  used France (ancient) differenced by a label gules, each point charged
  with three castles (towers) or.</p>

  <p>The rules which govern the marks of cadency at present in England are
  as follows, and it should be carefully borne in mind that the Scottish
  system bears no relation whatever to the English system. The eldest son
  during the lifetime of his father differences his arms by a label of
  three points couped at the ends. This is placed in the centre chief point
  of the escutcheon. There is no rule as to its colour, which is left to
  the pleasure of the bearer; but it is usually decided as follows: (1)
  That it shall not be metal on metal, or colour on colour; (2) that it
  shall not be argent or white; and, if possible, that it shall differ from
  any colour or metal in which any component part of the shield is
  depicted. Though anciently the label was drawn throughout the shield,
  this does not now seem to be a method officially adopted. At any rate
  drawn throughout it apparently obtains no official countenance for the
  arms of subjects, though many of the best heraldic artists always so
  depict it. The eldest son bears this label during his father's lifetime,
  succeeding to the undifferenced shield on the death of his father. His
  children&mdash;being the grandchildren of the then head of the
  house&mdash;difference upon the label, but such difference marks are,
  like their father's, only contemporary with the life of the grandfather,
  and, immediately upon the succession of their father, the children remove
  the label, and difference upon the original arms. The use of arms by a
  junior grandson is so restricted in ordinary life that to all intents and
  purposes this may be ignored, except in the case of the heir-apparent of
  the heir-apparent, <i>i.e.</i> of the grandson in the lifetimes of his
  father and grandfather. In his case one label of <i>five</i> points is
  used, and to place a label upon a label is not correct when both are
  marks of cadency, and not charges. But the grandson on the death of his
  father, during the lifetime of the grandfather, and when the grandson
  succeeds as heir-apparent of the grandfather, succeeds also to the label
  of three points, which may therefore more properly be described as the
  difference mark of the heir-apparent than the difference mark of the
  eldest son. It is necessary, perhaps, having said this, to add the remark
  that heraldry knows no such thing as disinheritance, and heirship is an
  inalienable matter of blood descent, and not of worldly inheritance. No
  woman can ever be an heir-apparent. Though now <!-- Page 488 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="548.png"><a name="page488"></a>{488}</span>the
  number of points on a label is a matter of rule, this is far from having
  been always the case, and prior to the Stuart period no deductions can be
  drawn with certainty from the number of the points in use. It seems a
  very great pity that no warrants were issued for the children of the then
  Duke of York during the lifetime of Queen Victoria, as labels for
  <i>great</i><span class="nw">-grandchildren</span> would have been quite
  unique.</p>

  <p>If the eldest son succeeds through the death of his mother to her arms
  and quarterings during his father's lifetime, he must be careful that the
  label which he bears as heir-apparent to his father's arms does not cross
  the quartering of his mother's arms.</p>

  <p>If his father bears a quarterly shield, the label is so placed that it
  shall apparently debruise all his father's quarterings, <i>i.e.</i> in a
  shield quarterly of four the label would be placed in the centre chief
  point, the centre file of the label being upon the palar line, and the
  other files in the first and second quarters respectively, whilst the
  colour would usually depend, as has been above indicated, upon the
  tinctures of the pronominal arms. Due regard, however, must be had that a
  label of gules, for example, is not placed on a field of gules. A
  parti-coloured label is not nowadays permissible, though instances of its
  use can occasionally be met with in early examples. Supposing the field
  of the first quarter is argent, and that of the second azure, in all
  probability the best colour for the label would be gules, and indeed
  gules is the colour most frequently met with for use in this purpose.</p>

  <p>If the father possess the quarterly coat of, say, four quarterings,
  which are debruised by a label by the heir-apparent, and the mother die,
  and the heir-apparent succeed to her arms, he would of course, after his
  father's death, arrange his mother's quarterings with these, placing his
  father's pronominal arms 1 and 4, the father's quartering in the second
  quarter, and the mother's arms in the third quarter. This arrangement,
  however, is not permissible during his father's lifetime, because
  otherwise his label in chief would be held to debruise <i>all</i> the
  four coats, and the only method in which such a combination could be
  properly displayed in the lifetime of the father but after the death of
  his mother is to place the father's arms in the grand quartering in the
  first and fourth quarters, each being debruised by the label, and the
  mother's in the grand quartering in the second and third quarters without
  any interference by the label.</p>

  <p>The other marks of difference are: For the second son a crescent; for
  the third son a mullet; for the fourth son a martlet; for the fifth son
  an annulet; for the sixth son a fleur-de-lis; for the seventh son a rose;
  for the eighth son a cross moline; for the ninth son a double quatrefoil
  (Fig. 699).</p>

  <p>Of these the first six are given in <span
  class="sc">Bossewell's</span> "Workes of <!-- Page 489 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="549.png"><a
  name="page489"></a>{489}</span>Armorie" (1572), and the author adds: "If
  there be any more than six brethren the devise or assignment of further
  difference only appertaineth to the kingis of armes especially when they
  visite their severall provinces; and not to the father of the children to
  give them what difference he list, as some without authoritie doe
  allege."</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    699.</span>&mdash;The English marks of cadency.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The position for a mark of difference is in the centre chief point,
  though it is not incorrect (and many such instances will be found) for it
  to be charged on a chevron or fess, in the centre point. This, however,
  is not a very desirable position for it in a simple coat of arms. The
  second son of the second son places a crescent upon a crescent, the third
  son a mullet on a crescent, the fourth son a martlet on a crescent, and
  so on; and there is an instance in the Visitation of London in which the
  arms of Cokayne appear with <i>three</i> crescents one upon another: this
  instance has been already referred to on page 344. Of course, when the
  English system is carried to these lengths it becomes absurd, because the
  crescents charged one upon each other become so small as to be
  practically indistinguishable. There are, however, very few cases in
  which such a display would be correct&mdash;as will be presently
  explained. This difficulty, which looms large in theory, amounts to very
  little in the practical use of armory, but it nevertheless is the one
  outstanding objection to the English system of difference marks. It is
  constantly held up to derision by those people who are unaware of the
  next rule upon the subject, which is, that as soon as a quartering comes
  into the possession of a cadet branch&mdash;which quartering is not
  enjoyed by the head of the house&mdash;all necessity for any marks of
  difference at all is considered to be ended, provided that that
  quartering is always displayed&mdash;and that cadet branch then begins
  afresh from that generation to redifference.</p>

  <p>Now there are few English families in whose pedigree during three or
  four generations one marriage is not with an heiress in blood, so that
  this theoretical difficulty very quickly disappears.</p>

  <p>No doubt there is always an inducement to retain the quarterings of an
  historical or illustrious house which may have been brought in in the
  past, but if the honours and lands brought in with that quartering are
  wholly enjoyed by the head of the house, it becomes, from a practical
  point of view, mere affectation to prefer that quartering to another
  (brought in subsequently) of a family, the entire representation of which
  belongs to the junior branch and not to the senior. If <!-- Page 490
  --><span class="pagenum" title="550.png"><a
  name="page490"></a>{490}</span>the old idea of confining a shield to four
  quarters be borne in mind, concurrently with the necessity&mdash;for
  purposes of distinction&mdash;of introducing new quarterings, the new
  quarterings take the place of the old, the use of which is left to the
  senior branch. Under such circumstances, and the regular practice of
  them, the English system is seldom wanting, and it at once wipes out the
  difficulty which is made much of&mdash;that under the English system
  there is no way of indicating the difference between the arms of uncle
  and nephew. If the use of impalements is also adhered to, the difficulty
  practically vanishes.</p>

  <p>To difference a <i>single</i> coat the mark of difference is placed in
  the centre chief point; to difference a <i>quarterly</i> coat of four
  quarters the same position on the shield is most generally used, the mark
  being placed over the palar line, though occasionally the difference mark
  is placed, and not incorrectly, in the centre of the quarterings. A coat
  of six quarters, however, is always differenced on the fess line of
  partition, the mark being placed in the fess point, because if placed in
  the centre chief point it would only appear as a difference upon the
  second quartering, so that on all shields of six or more quarterings the
  difference mark must be placed on some line of partition at the nearest
  possible point to the true centre fess point of the escutcheon. It is
  then understood to difference the whole of the quarterings over which it
  is displayed, but directly a quartering is introduced which has been
  inherited subsequently to the cadency which produced the difference mark,
  that difference mark must be either discarded or transferred to the first
  quartering only.</p>

  <p><i>The use of these difference marks is optional.</i> Neither
  officially nor unofficially is any attempt made to enforce their use in
  England&mdash;they are left to the pleasure and discretion of the
  bearers, though it is a well-understood and well-accepted position that,
  unless differenced by quarterings or impalement, it is neither courteous
  nor proper for a cadet to display the arms of the head of his house:
  beyond this, the matter is usually left to good taste.</p>

  <p>There is, however, one position in which the use of difference marks
  is compulsory. If under a Royal Licence, or other
  exemplification&mdash;for instance, the creation of a peerage&mdash;a
  difference mark is painted upon the arms, or even if an exemplification
  of the arms differenced is placed at the head of an official record of
  pedigree, those arms would not subsequently be exemplified, or their use
  officially admitted, without the difference mark that has been recorded
  with them.</p>

  <p>The differencing of crests for cadency is very rare. Theoretically,
  these should be marked equally with the shield, and when arms are
  exemplified officially under the circumstances above referred to, crest,

  <p>supporters, and shield are all equally differenced, but the difficulty
  of adding difference mark on difference mark when no marriage or heiress
  can ever bring in any alteration to the crest is very generally
  recognised and admitted, even officially, and it is rare indeed to come
  across a crest carrying more than a single difference mark.</p>

  <p>The grant of an augmentation to any cadet obviates the slightest
  necessity for any further use of difference marks inherited before the
  grant.</p>

  <p>There are no difference marks whatever for daughters, there being in
  English common law no seniority between the different daughters of one
  man. They succeed equally, whether heiresses or not, to the arms of their
  father for use during their lifetimes, and they must bear them on their
  own lozenges or impaled on the shields of their husbands, with the
  difference marks which their father needed to use. It would be
  permissible, however, to discard these difference marks of their fathers
  if subsequently to his death his issue succeeded to the position of head
  of the family. For instance, suppose the daughters of the younger son of
  an earl are under consideration. They would bear upon lozenges the arms
  of their father, which would be those of the earl, charged with the
  mullet or crescent which their father had used as a younger son. If by
  the extinction of issue the brother of these daughters succeed to the
  earldom, they would no longer be required to bear their father's
  difference mark.</p>

  <p>There are no marks of difference between illegitimate children. In the
  eye of the law an illegitimate person has no relatives, and stands alone.
  Supposing it be subsequently found that a marriage ceremony had been
  illegal, the whole issue of that marriage becomes of course illegitimate.
  As such, no one of them is entitled to bear arms. A Royal Licence, and
  exemplification following thereupon, is necessary for each single one. Of
  these exemplifications there is one case on record in which I think nine
  follow each other on successive pages of one of the Grant Books: all
  differ in some way&mdash;usually in the colour of the bordure; but the
  fact that there are illegitimate brothers of the same parentage does not
  prevent the descendants of any daughter quartering the differenced coat
  exemplified to her. As far as heraldic law is concerned, she is the
  heiress of herself, representing only herself, and consequently her heir
  quarters her arms.</p>

  <p>Marks of difference are never added to an exemplification following
  upon a Royal Licence <i>after illegitimacy</i>. Marks of difference are
  to indicate cadency, and there is no cadency vested in a person of
  illegitimate birth&mdash;their right to the arms proceeding only from the
  regrant of them in the exemplification. What is added in lieu is the
  <i>mark of distinction</i> to indicate the bastardy. <!-- Page 493

  <p>The method of differencing the English Royal Arms is quite unique, and
  has no relation to the method ordinarily in use in this country for the
  arms of subjects. The Royal Arms are not personal. They are the sovereign
  arms of dominion, indicating the sovereignty enjoyed by the person upon
  the throne. Consequently they are in no degree hereditary, and from the
  earliest times, certainly since the reign of Edward I., the right to bear
  the undifferenced arms has been confined exclusively to the sovereign
  upon the throne. In early times there were two methods employed, namely,
  the use of the bordure and of varieties of the label, the label of the
  heir-apparent to the English throne being originally of azure. The arms
  of Thomas of Woodstock, the youngest son of Edward I., were differenced
  by a bordure argent; his elder brother, Thomas de Brotherton, having had
  a label of three points argent; whilst the eldest son, Edward II., as
  Prince of Wales used a label of three points azure. From that period to
  the end of the Tudor period the use of labels and bordures seems to have
  continued concurrently, some members of the Royal Family using one, some
  the other, though there does not appear to have been any precise rules
  governing a choice between the two. When Edward III. claimed the throne
  of France and quartered the arms of that country with those of England,
  of course a portion of the field then became azure, and a blue label upon
  a blue field was no longer possible. The heir-apparent therefore
  differenced his shield by the plain label of three points argent, and
  this has ever since, down to the present day, continued to be the
  "difference" used by the heir-apparent to the English throne. A label of
  gules upon the gules quartering of England was equally impossible, and
  consequently from that period all labels used by any member of the Royal
  Family have been argent, charged with different objects, these being
  frequently taken from the arms of some female ancestor. Figs. 700 to 730
  are a somewhat extensive collection of variations of the Royal Arms.</p>

  <p>Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III., bore:
  France (ancient) and England quarterly, a label of three points argent,
  and on each point a canton gules.</p>

  <p>The use of the bordure as a legitimate difference upon the Royal Arms
  ceased about the Tudor period, and differencing between members of the
  Royal Family is now exclusively done by means of these labels. A few
  cases of bordures to denote illegitimacy can, however, be found. The
  method of deciding these labels is for separate warrants under the hand
  and seal of the sovereign to be issued to the different members of the
  Royal Family, assigning to each a certain coronet, and the label to be
  borne over the Royal Arms, crest, and supporters. These warrants are
  personal to those for whom they are <!-- Page 495 --><span

  <p>issued, and are not hereditary. Of late their use, or perhaps may be
  their issue, has not been quite so particularly conformed to as is
  desirable, and at the present time the official records show the arms of
  their Royal Highnesses the Duchess of Fife, the Princess Victoria, and
  the Queen of Norway, still bearing the label of five points indicative of
  their position as grandchildren of the sovereign, which of course they
  were when the warrants were issued in the lifetime of the late Queen
  Victoria. In spite of the fact that the warrants have no hereditary
  limitation, I am only aware of two modern instances in which a warrant
  has been issued to the son of a cadet of the Royal House who had
  previously received a warrant. One of these was the late Duke of
  Cambridge. The warrant was issued to him in his father's lifetime, and to
  the label previously assigned to his father a second label of three
  points gules, to be borne directly below the other, was added. The other
  case was that of his cousin, afterwards Duke of Cumberland and King of
  Hanover. In his case the second label, also gules, was charged with the
  white horse of Hanover.</p>

  <p>The label of the eldest son of the heir-apparent to the English throne
  is not, as might be imagined, a plain label of five points, but the plain
  label of three points, the centre point only being charged. The late Duke
  of Clarence charged the centre point of his label of <!-- Page 497

  name="page497"></a>{497}</span>three points with a cross couped gules.
  After his death the Duke of York relinquished the label of five points
  which he had previously borne, receiving one of three, the centre point
  charged with an anchor. In every other case all of the points are
  charged. The following examples of the labels in use at the moment will
  show how the system now exists:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Prince of Wales.</i>&mdash;A label of three points argent.</p>

  <p><i>Princess Royal</i> (Louise, Duchess of Fife).&mdash;A label of five
  points argent, charged on the centre and outer points with a cross of St.
  George gules, and on the two others with a thistle proper.</p>

  <p><i>Princess Victoria.</i>&mdash;A label of five points argent, charged
  with three roses and two crosses gules.</p>

  <p><i>Princess Maud</i> (H.M. The Queen of Norway).&mdash;A label of five
  points argent, charged with three hearts and two crosses gules.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Edinburgh</i> (Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha).&mdash;A
  label of three points argent, the centre point charged with a cross
  gules, and on each of the others an anchor azure. His son, the hereditary
  Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who predeceased his father, bore a label
  of five points, the first, third, and fifth each charged with a cross
  gules, and the second and fourth each with an anchor azure (Fig.
  731).</p>

  <p><i>The Dukes of Cambridge.</i>&mdash;The first Duke had a label of
  three points argent, the centre point charged with a St. George's cross,
  and each of the other two with <i>two</i> hearts in pale gules. The
  warrant to the late Duke assigned him the same label with the addition of
  a second label, plain, of three points gules, to be borne below the
  former label.</p>

  <p><i>The first Duke of Cumberland.</i>&mdash;A label of three points
  argent, the centre point charged with a fleur-de-lis azure, and each of
  the other two points with a cross of St. George gules.</p>

  <p>Of the foregoing recently assigned labels all are borne over the plain
  English arms (1 and 4 England, 2 Scotland, 3 Ireland), charged with the
  escutcheon of Saxony, except those of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha,
  Cambridge, and Cumberland. In the two latter cases the labels are borne
  over the <i>latest</i> version of the arms of King George III.,
  <i>i.e.</i> with the inescutcheon of Hanover, but, of course, neither the
  electoral bonnet nor the later crown which surmounted the inescutcheon of
  Hanover was made use of, and the smaller inescutcheon bearing the crown
  of Charlemagne was also omitted for the children of George III., except
  in the case of the Prince of Wales, who bore the plain inescutcheon of
  gules, but without the crown of Charlemagne thereupon.</p>

  <p>The labels for the other sons and daughters of King George III. were
  as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of York.</i>&mdash;A label of three points argent, the
  centre point charged with a cross gules. The Duke of York bore upon the
  inescutcheon of Hanover an inescutcheon argent (in the place occupied in
  the Royal Arms by the inescutcheon charged with the crown of Charlemagne)
  charged with a wheel of six spokes gules, for the Bishopric of Osnaburgh,
  which he possessed.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Clarence</i> (afterwards William IV.).&mdash;A label of
  three points argent, the centre point charged with a cross gules, and
  each of the others with an anchor erect azure.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Kent</i> had his label charged with a cross gules
  between two fleurs-de-lis azure.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Sussex.</i>&mdash;The label argent charged with two
  hearts in pale gules in the centre point between two crosses gules.</p>

  <p><i>The Princess Royal</i> (Queen of Würtemberg).&mdash;A rose between
  two crosses gules.</p>

  <p><i>The Princess Augusta.</i>&mdash;A like label, charged with a rose
  gules between two ermine spots.</p>

  <p><i>The Princess Elizabeth</i> (Princess of Hesse-Homburg).&mdash;A
  like label charged with a cross between two roses gules.</p>

  <p><i>The Princess Mary</i> (Duchess of Gloucester).&mdash;A like label,
  charged with a rose between two cantons gules. <!-- Page 499 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="559.png"><a name="page499"></a>{499}</span></p>

  <p><i>The Princess Sophia.</i>&mdash;A like label, charged with a heart
  between two roses gules.</p>

  <p><i>The Princess Amelia.</i>&mdash;A like label, charged with a rose
  between two hearts gules.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Gloucester</i> (brother of George III.).&mdash;A label
  of <i>five</i> points argent, charged with a fleur-de-lis azure between
  four crosses gules. His son (afterwards Duke of Gloucester) bore an
  additional plain label of three points during the lifetime of his
  father.</p>

  <p>The Royal labels are placed across the shield, on the crest, and on
  each of the supporters. The crest stands upon and is crowned with a
  coronet identical with the circlet of any coronet of rank assigned in the
  same patent; the lion supporter is crowned and the unicorn supporter is
  gorged with a similar coronet. It may perhaps be of interest to note that
  no badges and no motto are ever now assigned in these Royal Warrants
  except in the case of the Prince of Wales.</p>

  <p>F.-M. H.S.H. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, the Consort of H.R.H. the
  Princess Charlotte (only child of George IV.), received by warrant dated
  April 7, 1818, the right "to use and bear the Royal Arms (without the
  inescocheon of Charlemagne's crown, and without the Hanoverian Royal
  crown) differenced with a label of five points argent, the centre point
  charged with a rose gules, quarterly with the arms of his illustrious
  House ['Barry of ten sable and or, a crown of rue in bend vert'], the
  Royal Arms in the first and fourth quarters."</p>

  <p>By Queen Victoria's desire this precedent was followed in the case of
  the late Prince Consort, the label in his case being of three points
  argent, the centre point charged with a cross gules, and, by a curious
  coincidence, the arms of his illustrious House, with which the Royal Arms
  were quartered, were again the arms of Saxony, these appearing in the
  second and third quarters.</p>

  <p>Quite recently a Royal Warrant has been issued for H.M. Queen
  Alexandra. This assigns, upon a single shield within the Garter, the
  undifferenced arms of His Majesty impaled with the undifferenced arms of
  Denmark. The shield is surmounted by the Royal crown. The supporters are:
  (dexter) the lion of England, and (sinister) a savage wreathed about the
  temples and loins with oak and supporting in his exterior hand a club all
  proper. This sinister supporter is taken from the Royal Arms of
  Denmark.</p>

  <p>Abroad there is now no equivalent whatever to our methods of
  differencing the Royal Arms. An official certificate was issued to me
  recently from Denmark of the undifferenced Royal Arms of Denmark
  certified as correct for the "Princes and Princesses" of that country.
  But the German Crown Prince bears his shield within a bordure gules, and
  anciently in France (from which country the English system was <!-- Page
  500 --><span class="pagenum" title="560.png"><a
  name="page500"></a>{500}</span>very probably originally derived) the
  differencing of the Royal French Arms for the younger branches seems to
  have been carefully attended to, as has been already specified.</p>

  <p>Differencing in Scotland is carried out on an entirely different basis
  from differencing in England. In Scotland the idea is still rigidly
  preserved and adhered to that the coat of arms of a family belongs only
  to the head of the family for the time being, and the terms of a Scottish
  grant are as follows: "Know ye therefore that we have devised and do by
  these presents assign ratify and confirm to the said &mdash;&mdash; and
  his descendants <i>with such congruent differences as may hereafter be
  matriculated for them the following ensigns armorial</i>." Under the
  accepted interpretation of Scottish armorial law, whilst the inherent
  gentility conferred by a patent of arms is not denied to cadets, no right
  to make use of arms is conceded to them until such time as they shall
  elect to matriculate the arms of their ancestor in their own names. This
  point has led to a much purer system of heraldry in Scotland than in
  England, and there is far less heraldic abuse in that country as a
  result, because the differences are decided not haphazardly by the user
  himself, as is the case in England, but by a competent officer of arms.
  Moreover the constant occasions of matriculation bring the arms
  frequently under official review. There is no fixed rule which decides
  <i>ipse facto</i> what difference shall be borne, and consequently this
  decision has retained in the hands of the heraldic executive an amount of
  control which they still possess far exceeding that of the executive in
  England, and perhaps the best way in which to state the rules which hold
  good will be to reprint a portion of one of the Rhind Lectures, delivered
  by Sir James Balfour Paul, which is devoted to the point:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have said that in Scotland the principle which limited the number
  of paternal coats led to a careful differencing of these coats as borne
  by the junior branches of the family. Though the English system was
  sometimes used, it has never obtained to any great extent in Scotland,
  the practice here being generally to difference by means of a bordure, in
  which way many more generations are capable of being distinguished than
  is possible by the English method. The weak point of the Scottish system
  is that, whilst the general idea is good, there is no definite rule
  whereby it can be carried out on unchanging lines; much is left to the
  discretion of the authorities.</p>

  <p>"As a general rule, it may be stated that the second son bears a plain
  bordure of the tincture of the principal charge in the shield, and his
  younger brothers also bear plain bordures of varying tinctures. In the
  next generation the eldest son of the second son would bear his father's
  coat and bordure without change; the second son would have the bordure
  engrailed; the third, invected; the fourth, indented, <!-- Page 501
  --><span class="pagenum" title="561.png"><a
  name="page501"></a>{501}</span>and so on, the other sons of the younger
  sons in this generation differencing their father's bordures in the same
  way. The junior members of the next generation might have their bordures
  parted per pale, the following generations having their bordures parted
  per fess and per saltire, per cross or quarterly, gyronny or compony,
  that is, divided into alternate spaces of metal or colour in a single
  trace&mdash;this, however, being often in Scotland a mark of
  illegitimacy&mdash;counter-compone or a similar pattern in two tracts, or
  chequy with three or more tracts.</p>

  <p>"You will see that these modifications of the simple bordure afford a
  great variety of differences, and when they are exhausted the expedient
  can then be resorted to of placing on the bordures charges taken from
  other coats, often from those of a maternal ancestor; or they may be
  arbitrarily assigned to denote some personal characteristic of the
  bearer, as in the case of James Maitland, Major in the Scots regiment of
  Foot Guards, who carries the dismembered lion of his family within a
  bordure wavy azure charged with eight hand grenades or, significant, I
  presume, of his military profession.</p>

  <p>"You will observe that, with all these varieties of differencing we
  have mentioned, the younger branches descending from the original eldest
  son of the parent house are still left unprovided with marks of cadency.
  These, however, can be arranged for by taking the ordinary which appears
  in their father's arms and modifying its boundary lines. Say the original
  coat was 'argent, a chevron gules,' the second son of the eldest son
  would have the chevron engrailed, but without any bordure; the third,
  invected, and so on; and the next generations the systems of bordures
  accompanying the modified chevron would go on as before. And when all
  these methods are exhausted, differences can still be made in a variety
  of ways, <i>e.g.</i> by charging the ordinary with similar charges in a
  similar manner to the bordure as Erskine of Shielfield, a cadet of
  Balgownie, who bore: 'Argent, on a pale sable, a cross crosslet fitchée
  or within a bordure azure'; or by the introduction of an ordinary into a
  coat which had not one previously, a bend or the ribbon (which is a small
  bend) being a favourite ordinary to use for this purpose. Again, we
  occasionally find a change of tincture of the field of the shield used to
  denote cadency.</p>

  <p>"There are other modes of differencing which need not be alluded to in
  detail, but I may say that on analysing the earlier arms in the Lyon
  Register, I find that the bordure is by far the most common method of
  indicating cadency, being used in no less than 1080 cases. The next most
  popular way is by changing the boundary lines of an ordinary, which is
  done in 563 shields; 233 cadets difference their arms by the insertion of
  a smaller charge on the ordinary and 195 on <!-- Page 502 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="562.png"><a name="page502"></a>{502}</span>the
  shield. A change of tincture, including counterchanging, is carried out
  in 155 coats, and a canton is added in 70 cases, while there are 350
  coats in which two or more of the above methods are used. From these
  figures, which are approximately correct, you will see the relative
  frequency of the various modes of differencing. You will also note that
  the original coat of a family can be differenced in a great many ways so
  as to show the connection of cadets with the parent house. The drawback
  to the system is that heralds have never arrived at a uniform treatment
  so as to render it possible to calculate the exact relationship of the
  cadets. Much is left, as I said, to the discretion of the officer
  granting the arms; but still it gives considerable assistance in
  determining the descent of a family."</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Stodart, Lyon Clerk Depute, who was an able herald,
  particularly in matters relating to Scotland, had elaborated a definite
  system of these bordures for differencing which would have done much to
  simplify Scottish cadency. Its weak point was obviously this, that it
  could only be applied to new matriculations of arms by cadets; and so, if
  adopted as a definite and unchangeable matter of rule, it might have
  occasioned doubt and misunderstanding in future times with regard to many
  important Scottish coats now existing, without reference to Mr. Stodart's
  system. But the scheme elaborated by Mr. Stodart is now accepted as the
  broad basis of the Scottish system for matriculations (Fig. 732).</p>

  <p>In early Scottish seals the bordures are to so large an extent
  engrailed as to make it appear that the later and present rule, which
  gives the plain bordure to immediate cadets, was not fully recognised or
  adopted. Bordures charged appear at a comparatively early date in
  Scotland. The bordure compony in Scotland and the bordure wavy in
  England, which are now used to signify illegitimacy, will be further
  considered in a subsequent chapter, but neither one nor the other
  originally carried any such meaning. The doubtful legitimacy of the
  Avondale and Ochiltree Stewarts, who bore the bordure compony in
  Scotland, along with its use by the Beauforts in England, has tended
  latterly to bring that difference into disrepute in the cadency of lawful
  sons&mdash;yet some of the bearers of that bordure during the first
  twenty years of the Lyon Register were unquestionably legitimate, whilst
  others, as <span class="sc">Scott</span> of Gorrenberry and <span
  class="sc">Patrick Sinclair</span> of Ulbester, were illegitimate, or at
  best only legitimated. The light in which the bordure compony had come to
  be regarded is shown by a Royal Warrant granted in 1679 to <span
  class="sc">John Lundin</span> of that Ilk, allowing him to drop the coat
  which his family had hitherto carried, and, as descended of a natural son
  of <span class="sc">William the Lion</span>, to bear the arms of Scotland
  within a bordure compony argent and azure. <!-- Page 503 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="563.png"><a name="page503"></a>{503}</span></p>

  <p>The bordure counter-compony is assigned to fifteen persons, none of
  them, it is believed, of illegitimate descent, and some expressly said to
  be "lineallie and lawfulie descended" from the ancestor whose arms they
  bore thus differenced. The idea of this bordure having been at any time a
  mark of bastardy is a very modern error, arising from a confusion with
  the bordure compony.</p>

    Stodart.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In conclusion, attention needs to be pointedly drawn to the fact that
  all changes in arms are not due to cadency, nor is it safe always to
  presume cadency from proved instances of change. Instead of merely
  detailing isolated instances of variation in a number of different
  families, the matter may be better illustrated by closely following the
  successive variations in the same family, and an instructive instance is
  met with in the case of the arms of the family of Swinton of that Ilk.
  This is peculiarly instructive, because at no point in the descent
  covered by the arms referred to is there any doubt or question as to the
  fact of legitimate descent.</p>

  <p>Claiming as they do a male descent and inheritance from Liulf the son
  of Edulf, Vicecomes of Northumbria, whose possession before <!-- Page 504
  --><span class="pagenum" title="564.png"><a
  name="page504"></a>{504}</span>1100 of the lands of Swinton is the
  earliest contemporary evidence which has come down to us of landowning by
  a Scottish subject, it is unfortunate that we cannot with authority date
  their armorial ensigns before the later half of the thirteenth century.
  Charters there are in plenty. Out of the twenty-three earliest Scottish
  writings given in the National MSS. of Scotland, nine, taken from the
  Coldingham documents preserved at Durham, refer to the village and lands
  of Swinton. Among these are two confirmations by David I., <i>i.e.</i>
  before 1153, of Swinton "in hereditate sibi et heredibus" to "meo militi
  Hernulfo" or "Arnolto isti meo Militi," the first of the family to follow
  the Norman fashion, and adopt the territorial designation of de Swinton;
  while at Durham and elsewhere, Cospatric de Swinton and his son Alan and
  grandson Alan appear more than eighty times in charters before 1250.</p>

  <p>But it is not till we come to <i>c.</i> 1271 that we find a Swinton
  seal still attached to a charter. This is a grant by a third Alan of the
  Kirk croft of Lower Swinton to God and the blessed Cuthbert and the
  blessed Ebba and the Prior and Monks of Coldingham. The seal is of a very
  early form (Fig. 733), and may perhaps have belonged to the father and
  grandfather of the particular Alan who uses it.</p>

  <p>Of the Henry de Swinton who came next, and who swore fealty to Edward
  the First of England at Berwick in 1296, and of yet a fourth Alan, no
  seals are known. These were turbulent days throughout Scotland: but then
  we find a distinct advance; a shield upon a diapered ground, and upon it
  the single boar has given place to the three boars' heads which
  afterwards became so common in Scotland. Nisbet lends his authority to
  the tradition that all the families of Border birth who carried
  them&mdash;Gordon, Nisbet, Swinton, Redpath, Dunse, he mentions, and he
  might have added others&mdash;were originally of one stock, and if so,
  the probability must be that the breed sprung from Swinton.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This seal (Fig. 734) was put by a second Henry de Swynton to one of
  the family charters, probably of the date of 1378, which have lately been
  placed for safe keeping in the Register House in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>His successor, Sir John, the hero of Noyon in Picardy, of Otterburn,
  and Homildon, was apparently the first of the race to use <!-- Page 505
  --><span class="pagenum" title="565.png"><a
  name="page505"></a>{505}</span>supporters. His seal (Fig. 735) belongs to
  the second earliest of the Douglas charters preserved at Drumlanrig. Its
  date is 1389, and Sir John de Swintoun is described as Dominus de Mar, a
  title he bore by right of his marriage with Margaret, Countess of Douglas
  and Mar. This probably also accounts for his coronet, and it is
  interesting to note that the helmet, coronet, and crest are the exact
  counterpart of those on the Garter plate of Ralph, Lord Basset, in St.
  George's Chapel at Windsor. It is possibly more than a coincidence, for
  Froissart mentions them both as fighting in France ten to twenty years
  earlier.</p>

  <p>Of his son, the second Sir John, "Lord of that Ilk," we have no seal.
  His lance it was that overthrew Thomas, Duke of Clarence, the brother of
  Henry V., at Beaugé in 1421, and he fell, a young man, three years later
  with the flower of the Scottish army at Verneuil; but in 1475 his son, a
  third Sir John, uses the identical crest and shield which his descendants
  carry to this day (Fig. 736). John had become a common name in the
  family, and the same or a similar seal did duty for the next three
  generations; but in 1598 we find the great-great-grandson, Robert Swinton
  of that Ilk, who represented Berwickshire in the first regularly
  constituted Parliament of Scotland, altering the character of the boars'
  heads (Fig. 737). He would also appear to have placed upon the chevron
  something which is difficult to decipher, but is probably the rose so
  borne by the Hepburns, his second wife having been a daughter of Sir
  Patrick Hepburn of Whitecastle.</p>

  <p>Whatever the charge was, it disappeared from the shield (Fig. 738)

  <p>Sir Alexander's son, John Swinton, "Laird Swinton" Carlyle calls him,
  wrecked the family fortunes. According to Bishop Burnet he was "the man
  of all Scotland most trusted and employed by Cromwell," and he died a
  Quaker, excommunicated and forfeited. To the circumstance that when, in
  1672, the order went out that all arms were to be officially recorded, he
  was a broken man under sentence that his arms should be "laceret and
  delete out of the Heralds' Books," we probably owe it that until of late
  years no Swinton arms appeared on the Lyon Register.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXII</h5>

<h5>MARKS OF BASTARDY</h5>

  <p>It has been remarked that the knowledge of "the man in the street" is
  least incorrect when he knows nothing. Probably the only heraldic
  knowledge that a large number possess is summed up in the assertion that
  the heraldic sign of illegitimacy is the "bar sinister."</p>

  <p>No doubt it is to the novelists&mdash;who, seeking to touch lightly
  upon an unpleasant subject, have ignorantly adopted a French
  colloquialism&mdash;that we must attribute a great deal of the
  misconception which exists concerning illegitimacy and its heraldic marks
  of indication. I assert most unhesitatingly that there are not now and
  never have been any unalterable laws as to what these marks should be,
  and the colloquialism which insists upon the "bar sinister" is a
  curiously amusing example of an utter misnomer. To any one with the most
  rudimentary knowledge of heraldry it must plainly be seen to be radically
  impossible to depict a bar sinister, for the simple reason that the bar
  is neither dexter nor sinister. It is utterly impossible to draw a bar
  sinister&mdash;such a thing does not exist. But the assertion of many
  writers with a knowledge of armory that "bar sinister" is a mistake for
  "bend sinister" is also somewhat misleading, because the real mistake
  lies in the spelling of the term. The "barre sinistre" is merely the
  French translation of bend sinister, the French word "barre" meaning a
  <i>bend</i>. The French "barre" is not the English "bar."</p>

  <p>In order to properly understand the true significance of the marks of
  illegitimacy, it is necessary that the attempt should be made to
  transplant oneself into the environment when the laws and rules of
  heraldry were in the making. At that period illegitimacy was of little if
  any account. It has not debarred the succession of some of our own
  sovereigns, although, from the earliest times, the English have always
  been more prudish upon the point than other nations. In Ireland, even so
  late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it is a striking genealogical
  difficulty to decide in many noble pedigrees which if any of the given
  sons of any person were legitimate, and which of the ladies of his
  household, if any, might be legally termed his wife. In Scotland we find
  the same thing, though perhaps it is not quite so <!-- Page 509 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="569.png"><a name="page509"></a>{509}</span>blatant
  to so late a date, but considering what are and have been the Scottish
  laws of marriage, it is the <i>fact</i> or otherwise of marriage which
  has to be ascertained; and though in England the legal status was
  recognised from an earlier period, the social status of the illegitimate
  offspring of a given man depended little upon the legal legitimacy of
  birth, but rather upon the amount of recognition the bastard received
  from his father. If a man had an unquestionably legitimate son, that son
  undoubtedly succeeded; but if he had not, any technical stain upon the
  birth of the others had little effect in preventing their succession. A
  study of the succession to the Barony of Meinill clearly shows that the
  illegitimate son of the second Lord Meinill succeeded to the estates and
  peerage of his father in preference to his legitimate uncle. There are
  many other analogous cases. And when the Church juggled at its pleasure
  with the sacrament of marriage&mdash;dispensing and annulling or
  recognising marriages for reasons which we nowadays can only term
  whimsical&mdash;small wonder is it that the legal fact, though then
  admitted, had little of the importance which we now give to it. When the
  actual fact was so little more than a matter at the personal pleasure of
  the person most concerned, it would be ridiculous to suppose that any
  perpetuation of a mere advertisement of the fact would be considered
  necessary, whilst the fact itself was so often ignored; so that until
  comparatively recent times the Crown certainly never attempted to enforce
  any heraldic marks of illegitimacy. Rather were these enforced by the
  legitimate descendants if and when such descendants existed.</p>

  <p>The point must have first arisen when there were both legitimate and
  illegitimate descendants of a given person, and it was desired to make
  record of the true line in which land or honours should descend. To
  effect this purpose, the arms of the illegitimate son were made to carry
  some charge or alteration to show that there was some reason which
  debarred inheritance by their users, whilst there remained those entitled
  to bear the arms without the mark of distinction. But be it noted that
  this obligation existed equally on the legitimate cadets of a family, and
  in the earliest periods of heraldry there is little or no distinction
  either in the marks employed or in the character of the marks, which can
  be drawn between mere marks of cadency and marks of illegitimacy. Until a
  comparatively recent period it is absolutely unsafe to use these marks as
  signifying or proving either legitimate cadency or illegitimacy. The same
  mark stood for both, the only object which any distinctive change
  accomplished, being the distinction which it was necessary to draw
  between those who owned the right to the undifferenced arms, and owned
  the land, and those who did not. The object was to safeguard the right of
  the real <!-- Page 510 --><span class="pagenum" title="570.png"><a
  name="page510"></a>{510}</span>possessors and their true heirs, and not
  to penalise the others. There was no particular mark either for cadency
  or for illegitimacy, the distinctions made being dictated by what seemed
  the most suitable and distinctive mark applicable to the arms under
  consideration.</p>

  <p>When that much has been thoroughly grasped, one gets a more accurate
  understanding of the subject. One other point has to be borne in mind
  (and to the present generation, which knows so well how extensively arms
  have been improperly assumed, the statement may seem startling), and that
  is, that the use of arms was formerly evidence of pedigree. As late as
  the beginning of the nineteenth century evidence of this character was
  submitted to the Committee of Privileges at the hearing of a Peerage
  case. The evidence was <i>admitted</i> for that purpose, though doubt (in
  that case very properly) was thrown upon its value.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in view of the two foregoing facts, there can be very
  little doubt that the use of armorial marks of bastardy <i>was not
  invented or instituted, nor were these marks enforced, as punishment or
  as a disgrace</i>.</p>

  <p>It is a curious instance how a careful study of words and terms
  employed will often afford either a clue or confirmation, when the true
  meaning of the term has long been overlooked.</p>

  <p>The official term for a mark of cadency is a "difference" mark,
  <i>i.e.</i> it was a mark to show the difference between one member of a
  family and another. The mark used to signify a lack of blood
  relationship, and a mark used to signify illegitimacy are each termed a
  "mark of distinction," <i>i.e.</i> a mark that shall make something
  plainly "distinct." What is that something? The fact that the use of the
  arms is not evidence of descent through which heirship can be claimed or
  proved. This, by the way, is a patent example of the advantage of
  adherence to precedent.</p>

  <p>The inevitable conclusion is that a bastard was originally only
  required to mark his shield sufficiently that it should be distinctly
  apparent that heirship would never accrue. The arms had to be distinct
  from those borne by those members of the family upon whom heirship might
  devolve. The social position of a bastard as "belonging" to a family was
  pretty generally conceded, therefore he carried their arms, sufficiently
  marked to show he was not in the line of succession.</p>

  <p>This being accepted, one at once understands the great variety of the
  marks which have been employed. These answered the purpose of
  distinction, and nothing more was demanded or necessary. Consequently a
  recapitulation of marks, of which examples can be quoted, would be
  largely a list of isolated instances, and as such they are useless for
  the purposes of deduction in any attempt to arrive at a correct
  conclusion as to what the ancient rules were. In brief, there were no
  <!-- Page 511 --><span class="pagenum" title="571.png"><a
  name="page511"></a>{511}</span>rules until the eighteenth, or perhaps
  even until the nineteenth century. The only rule was that the arms must
  be sufficiently marked in <i>some</i> way. This is borne out by the
  dictum of Menêstrier.</p>

  <p>Except the label, which has been elsewhere referred to, the earliest
  marks of either cadency or illegitimacy for which accepted use can be
  found are the bend and the bordure; but the bend for the purpose of
  illegitimacy seems to be the earlier, and a bend superimposed over a
  shield remained a mark of illegitimate cadency until a comparatively late
  period. This bend as a difference naturally was originally depicted as a
  bend dexter, and as a mark of legitimate cadency is found in the arms of
  the <i>younger</i> son of Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, before he
  succeeded his elder brother.</p>

  <p>There are scores of other similar instances which a little research
  will show. Whether the term "left-handed marriage" is the older, and the
  sinister bend is derived therefrom, or whether the slang term is derived
  from the sinister bend, it is perhaps not necessary to inquire. But there
  is no doubt that from an early period the bend of cadency, when such
  cadency was illegitimate, is frequently met with in the sinister form.
  But concurrently with such usage instances are found in which the dexter
  bend was used for the same purpose, and it is very plainly evident that
  it was never at that date looked upon as a penalty, but was used merely
  as a <i>distinction</i>, or for the purpose of showing that the wearer
  was not the head of his house or in possession of the lordship. The
  territorial idea of the nature of arms, which has been alluded to in the
  chapter upon marks of cadency, should be borne in mind in coming to a
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>Soon after the recognition of the bend as a mark of illegitimacy we
  come across the bordure; but there is some confusion with this, bordures
  of all kinds being used indiscriminately to denote both legitimate and
  illegitimate cadency. There are countless other forms of marking
  illegitimacy, and it is impossible to attempt to summarise them, and
  absolutely impossible to draw conclusions as to any family from marks
  upon its arms when this point is under discussion. To give a list of
  these instances would rather seem an attempt to deduce a rule or rules
  upon the point, so I say at once that there was no recognised mark, and
  any plain distinction seems to have been accepted as sufficient; and no
  distinction whatever was made when the illegitimate son, either from
  failure of legitimate issue or other reason, succeeded to the lands and
  honours of his father. Out of the multitude of marks, the bend, and
  subsequently the bend sinister, emerge as most frequently in use, and
  finally the bend sinister exclusively; so that it has come to be
  considered, and perhaps correctly as regards one period, that its use was
  equivalent to a mark of illegitimacy in England. <!-- Page 512 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="572.png"><a name="page512"></a>{512}</span></p>

  <p>But there has always remained to the person of bastard descent the
  right of discarding the bastardised coat, and adopting a new coat of
  arms, the only requirement as to the new coat being that it shall be so
  distinct from the old one as not to be liable to confusion therewith. And
  it is a moot point whether or not a large proportion of the instances
  which are tabulated in most heraldic works as examples of marks of
  bastardy are anything whatever of the kind. My own opinion is that many
  are not, and that it is a mistake to so consider them; the true
  explanation undoubtedly in some&mdash;and outside the Royal Family
  probably in most&mdash;being that they are new coats of arms adopted
  <i>as</i> new coats of arms, doubtless bearing relation to the old family
  coat, but sufficiently distinguished therefrom to rank as new arms, and
  were never intended to be taken as, and never were bastardised examples
  of formerly existing coats. It is for this reason that I have refrained
  from giving any extensive list such as is to be found in most other
  treatises on heraldry, for all that can be said for such lists is that
  they are lists of the specific arms of specific bastards, which is a very
  different matter from a list of heraldic marks of illegitimacy.</p>

  <p>Another objection to the long lists which most heraldic works give of
  early instances of marks of bastardy as data for deduction lies in the
  fact that most are instances of the illegitimate children of Royal
  personages. It is singularly unsafe to draw deductions, to be applied to
  the arms of others, from the Royal Arms, for these generally have laws
  unto themselves.</p>

  <p>The bend sinister in its bare simplicity, as a mark of illegitimacy,
  was seldom used, the more frequent form being the sinister bendlet, or
  even the diminutive of that, the cottise. There is no doubt, of course,
  that when a sinister bend or bendlet debruises another coat that that is
  a bastardised version of an older coat, but examples can be found of the
  sinister bend as a charge which has no reference whatever to
  illegitimacy. Two instances that come to mind, which can be found by
  reference to any current peerage, are the arms of Shiffner and
  Burne-Jones. Certainly in these cases I know of no illegitimacy, and
  neither coat is a bastardised version of an older existing coat.
  Anciently the bendlet was drawn across arms and quarterings, and an
  example of a coat of arms of some number of quarterings debruised for an
  illegitimate family is found in the registration of a Talbot pedigree in
  one of the Visitation Books. As a mark of distinction upon arms the bend
  sinister for long past has fallen out of use, though for the purpose of
  differencing crests a bendlet wavy sinister is still made use of, and
  will be again presently referred to.</p>

  <p>Next to the bend comes the bordure. Bordures of all kinds were used
  for the purposes of cadency from practically the earliest periods <!--
  Page 513 --><span class="pagenum" title="573.png"><a
  name="page513"></a>{513}</span>of heraldic differencing. But they were
  used indiscriminately, as has been already stated, both for legitimate
  and illegitimate cadency. John of Gaunt, as is well known, was the father
  of Henry IV. and the ancestor of Henry VII., the former being the issue
  of his legitimate wife, the latter coming from a son who, as one of the
  old chroniclers puts it, "was of double advowtrie begotten." But, as
  every one knows, John of Gaunt's children by Catherine Roet or Swynford
  were legitimated by Act of Parliament, the Act of Parliament not
  excepting the succession to the Throne, a disability later introduced in
  Letters Patent of the Crown when giving a subsequent confirmation of the
  Act, but which, nevertheless, they could not overrule. But taking the
  sons of the latter family as legitimate, which (whatever may have been
  the moral aspect of the case) they were undoubtedly in the eyes of the
  common law after the passing of the Act referred to, they existed
  concurrently with the undoubtedly senior descendants of the first
  marriage of John of Gaunt with Blanche of Lancaster, and it was
  necessary&mdash;whether they were legitimate or not&mdash;to distinguish
  the arms of the junior from the senior branch. The result was that as
  legitimate cadets, and not as bastards, the arms of John of Gaunt were
  differenced for the line of the Dukes of Somerset by the addition of the
  bordure compony argent and azure&mdash;the livery colours of Lancaster.
  It is a weird position, for these colours were derived from the family of
  the legitimate wife.</p>

  <p>The fight as to whether these children were legitimate or illegitimate
  was, of course, notorious, and a matter of history; but from the fact
  that they bore a bordure compony, an idea grew up both in this country
  and in Scotland also from the similarity of the cases of the doubtful
  legitimacy of the Avondale and Ochiltree Stewarts, who both used the
  bordure compony, that the bordure compony was a sign of illegitimacy,
  whereas in both countries at an earlier period it undoubtedly was
  accepted as a mark of legitimate cadency.</p>

  <p>As a mark of bastardy it had subsequently some extensive use in both
  countries, and it still remains the only mark now used for the purpose in
  Scottish heraldry. Whether it was that it was not considered as of a
  fixed nature, or whether it was that it had become notorious and
  unacceptable, it is difficult to say, though the officers of arms have
  been blamed for making a change on the assumption that it was the
  latter.</p>

  <p>Some writers who clamour strongly for the <i>penalising</i> of bastard
  arms, and for the plain and recognisable marking of them as such (a
  position adopted rather vehemently by Woodward, a singularly erudite
  heraldic writer), are rather uncharitable, and at the same time rather
  lacking in due observation and careful consideration of ancient ideas
  <!-- Page 514 --><span class="pagenum" title="574.png"><a
  name="page514"></a>{514}</span>and ancient precedents. That the
  recognised mark has been changed at different periods, and as a
  consequence that to a certain extent the advertisement it conveys has
  been less patent is, of course, put down to the "venality" of mediæval
  heralds (happily their backs are broad) by those who are too
  short-sighted to observe that the one thing an official herald moves
  heaven and earth to escape from is the making of a new precedent; and
  that, on the score of signs of illegitimacy, the official heralds, when
  the control of arms passed into their hands, found no established rule.
  So far from having been guilty of venality, as Woodward suggests, they
  have erred on the other side, and by having worked only on the limited
  number of precedents they found they have stereotyped the advertisement,
  and thereby made the situation more stringent than they found it.</p>

  <p>We have it from biblical sources that the sins of the fathers shall be
  visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generations, and this
  spirit has undoubtedly crept into the views of many writers, but to get
  into the true perspective of the matter one needs to consider the subject
  from the point of view of less prudish days than our own.</p>

  <p>I have no wish to be misunderstood. In these days much heraldic
  reviewing of the blatant and baser sort depends not upon the value of the
  work performed, a point of view which is never given a thought, but
  entirely upon the identity of the writer whose work is under review, and
  is largely composed of misquotation and misrepresentation. It may perhaps
  be as well, therefore, to state that I am not seeking to condone
  illegitimacy or to combat present opinions upon the point. I merely state
  that our present opinions are a modern growth, and that in the
  thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, when the
  fundamental principles of heraldry were in the making, it was not
  considered a disgrace to have an illegitimate son, nor was it considered
  then that to be of illegitimate birth carried the personal stigma that
  came later.</p>

  <p>At any rate, the fact remains that a new mark was called into being in
  England about the year 1780 when in a grant to Zachary to quarter the
  arms of Sacheverell, from which family he was in the female line
  illegitimately descended, the bordure wavy was first met with as a
  sufficient and proper mark of illegitimacy. The curious point is that
  before that date in Scotland and in England the bordure wavy possessed
  nothing of this character, and to the present day the bordure wavy in
  Scotland is undoubtedly nothing more than a legitimate mark of legitimate
  cadency, for which mark Mr. Stodart provides a place in the scheme of
  differencing which he tabulated as the basis of cadency marks in Scotland
  (Fig. 732). Since that date the bordure wavy has <!-- Page 515 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="575.png"><a
  name="page515"></a>{515}</span>remained the mark which has been used for
  the purpose in England, as the bordure compony has remained the mark in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>Bearing in mind that the only necessity was some mark which should
  carry sufficient <i>distinction</i> from the arms of the family, it
  follows, as a natural consequence of human nature, that as soon as any
  particular mark became identified with illegitimacy (after that was
  considered to be a stigma), that mark was quietly dropped and some other
  substituted, and no one should be surprised to find the bordures wavy and
  compony quietly displaced by something else. If any change is to be made
  in the future it is to be hoped that no existing mark will be adopted,
  and that the marks in England and Scotland shall not conflict even if
  they do not coincide.</p>

  <p>The bendlet sinister, however, survives in the form of the baton
  sinister, which is a bendlet couped placed across the centre of the
  shield. The baton sinister, however, is a privilege which, as a charge on
  a shield, is reserved, such as it is, for Royal bastards. The latest
  instance of this was in the exemplification of arms to the Earl of
  Munster and his brothers and sisters early in the nineteenth century.
  Other surviving instances are met with in the arms of the Duke of St.
  Albans and the Duke of Grafton. Another privilege of Royal bastards is
  that they may have the baton of <i>metal</i>, a privilege which is,
  according to Berry, denied to those of humbler origin.</p>

  <p>According to present law the position of an illegitimate person
  heraldically is based upon the common law of the country, which
  practically declares that an illegitimate child has no name, no
  parentage, and no relations. The illegitimacy of birth is an insuperable
  bar to inheritance, and a person of illegitimate birth inherits no arms
  at all, the popular idea that he inherits a right to the arms subject to
  a mark of distinction being quite incorrect. He has none at all. There
  has never been any mark which, as a matter of course and of mere motion,
  could attach itself automatically to a shield, as is the case with the
  English marks of difference, <i>e.g.</i> the crescent of the second son
  or the mullet of the third. This is a point upon which I have found
  mistaken ideas very frequently held, even by those who have made some
  study of heraldry.</p>

  <p>But a very little thought should make it plain that by the very nature
  of the fact there cannot be either a recognised mark, compulsory use, or
  an <i>ipse facto</i> sign. Illegitimacy is negative, not positive&mdash;a
  fact which many writers hardly give sufficient weight to.</p>

  <p>If any one of illegitimate birth desires to obtain a right to arms he
  has two courses open to him. He can either (not disclosing the fact of
  his illegitimacy, and not attempting to prove that he is a descendant of
  any kind from any one else) apply for and obtain a new grant of <!-- Page
  516 --><span class="pagenum" title="576.png"><a
  name="page516"></a>{516}</span>arms on his own basis, and worry through
  the College the grant of a coat as closely following in design that of
  the old family as he can get, which means that he would be treated and
  penalised with such <i>alterations</i> (not "marks of distinction") as
  would be imposed upon a stranger in blood endeavouring to obtain arms
  founded upon a coat to which he had no right. The cost of such a
  proceeding in England is £76, 10s., the usual fees upon an ordinary
  grant.</p>

  <p>The alternative course is simple. He must avow himself a bastard, and
  must prove his paternity or maternity, as the case may be (for in the eye
  of the law&mdash;common and heraldic&mdash;he bears the same relation,
  which is nil, and the same right to the name and arms, which is nil, of
  both his father and his mother).</p>

  <p>Illegitimacy under English law affords one of the many instances in
  which anomalies exist, for, strange as the statement is, a bastard comes
  into the world without any name at all.</p>

  <p>Legally, at birth a bastard child has then no name at all, and no
  arms. It must subsequently acquire such right to a name (whatever right
  that may amount to) as user of and reputation therein may give him. He
  inherits no arms at all, no name, and no property, save by specific
  devise or bequest. The lack of parents operates as a <i>chasm</i> which
  it is impossible to bridge. It is not a case of a peculiar bridge or a
  faulty bridge; there is no bridge at all.</p>

  <p>Names, in so far as they are matters of law, are subject to canon law;
  at any rate, the law upon the subject, such as it is, originated in canon
  law, and not in statute or common law. Canon law was made, and has never
  since been altered, at a time when surnames were not in existence. A
  bastard no more inherits the surname of the mother than it does the
  surname of its father; and the spirit of petty officialism, so rampant
  amongst the clergy, which seeks to impose upon a bastard <i>nolens
  volens</i> the surname of its mother, has no justification in law or
  fact. A bastard has precisely as little right to the surname of its
  mother as it has to the surname of its father. Obviously, however, under
  the customs of our present social life, every person must have a surname
  of one kind or another; and it is here that the anomaly in the British
  law exists, inasmuch as neither statute nor canon law provide any means
  for conferring a surname. That the King has the prerogative, and
  exercises it, of conferring or confirming surnames is, of course,
  unquestioned, but it is hardly to be supposed that the King will trouble
  himself to provide a surname for every illegitimate child which may be
  born; and outside this prerogative, which probably is exercised about
  once a year, there is no method provided or definitely recognised by the
  law to meet this necessity. To obviate the difficulty, the surname has to
  be that which is conferred upon the child by <!-- Page 517 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="577.png"><a name="page517"></a>{517}</span>general
  custom; and as an illegitimate child is in ninety-nine cases out of a
  hundred brought up by its mother, it is usually by the same custom which
  confers the surname of its owner upon a dog in so many parts of the
  country that a bastard child gets known by its mother's surname, and
  consequently has that surname conferred upon it by general custom. The
  only names that an illegitimate child has an inalienable right to are the
  names by which it is baptized; and if two names are given, and the child
  or its guardians elect that it should be known only by those baptismal
  names, and if common repute and general custom, as would be probable,
  uses the last of those names as a surname, there is no legal power on
  earth which can force upon the child any other name; and if the last of
  the baptismal names happens to be its father's surname, the child will
  have an absolute right to be known only by its Christian names, which to
  all intents and purposes will mean that it will be known by its father's
  surname.</p>

  <p>In the same way that an illegitimate child inherits no surname at all,
  it equally inherits no arms. Consequently it has no shield upon which to
  carry a mark of bastardy, if such a mark happened to be in existence. But
  if under a will or deed of settlement an illegitimate child is required
  to assume the name and arms of its father <i>or of its mother</i>, a
  Royal Licence to assume such name and arms is considered to be necessary.
  It may be here noted that voluntary applications to assume a name and
  arms in the case of an illegitimate child are not entertained unless it
  can be clearly shown (which is not always an easy matter) what the
  parentage really was.</p>

  <p>It will be noticed that I have said he will be required to prove his
  paternity. This is rigorously insisted upon, inasmuch as it is not fair
  to penalise the reputation of a dead man by inflicting upon him a record
  of bastard descendants whilst his own life might have been stainless. An
  illegitimate birth is generally recorded under the name of the mother
  only, and even when it is given, the truth of any statement as to
  paternity is always open to grave suspicion. There is nothing, therefore,
  to prevent a person asserting that he is the son of a duke, whereas his
  real father may have been in a very plebeian walk in life; and to put the
  arms of the duke's family at the mercy of any fatherless person who chose
  to fancy a differenced version of them would be manifestly unjust, so
  that without proof in a legal action of the actual paternity, or some
  recognition under a will or settlement, it is impossible to adopt the
  alternative in question. But if such recognition or proof is forthcoming,
  the procedure is to petition the Sovereign for a Royal Licence to use (or
  continue to use) the name desired and to bear the arms of the family.
  Such a petition is always granted, on <!-- Page 518 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="578.png"><a name="page518"></a>{518}</span>proper
  proof of the facts, if made in due form through the proper channels. The
  Royal Licence to that effect is then issued. But the document contains
  two conditions, the first being that the arms shall be exemplified
  according to the laws of arms "with due and proper marks of distinction,"
  and that the Royal Licence shall be recorded in the College of Arms,
  otherwise "to be void and of none effect." The invariable insertion of
  this clause puts into the hands of the College one of the strongest
  weapons the officers of arms possess.</p>

  <p>Under the present practice the due and proper marks of distinction
  are, for the arms, a bordure wavy round the shield of the most suitable
  colour, according to what the arms may be, but if possible of some colour
  or metal different from any of the tinctures in the arms. The crest is
  usually differenced by a bendlet sinister wavy, but a pallet wavy is
  sometimes used, and sometimes a saltire wavy, couped or otherwise. The
  choice between these marks generally depends upon the nature of the
  crest. But even with this choice, the anomaly is frequently found of
  blank space being carefully debruised. Seeing that the mark of the
  debruising is not a tangible object or thing, but a mark painted upon
  another object, such a result seems singularly ridiculous, and ought to
  be avoided. Whilst the ancient practice certainly appears to have been to
  make some slight change in the crest, it does not seem to have been
  debruised in the present manner. There are some number of more recent
  cases where, whilst the existing arms have been charged with the
  necessary marks of distinction, entirely new, or very much altered crests
  have been granted without any recognisable "marks of distinction." There
  can be no doubt that the bendlet wavy sinister upon the crest is a
  palpable penalising of the bearer, and I think the whole subject of the
  marks of bastardy in the three kingdoms might with advantage be brought
  under official consideration, with a view to new regulations being
  adopted. A bendlet wavy sinister is such an absolute defacement of a
  crest that few can care to make use of a crest so marked. It carries an
  effect far beyond what was originally the intention of marks of
  distinction.</p>

  <p>A few recent bastardised exemplifications which have issued from
  Ulster's Office have had the crest charged with a baton couped sinister.
  The baton couped sinister had always hitherto been confined to the arms
  of Royal bastards, but I am not aware of any Royal crest so bastardised.
  Of course no circumstances can be conceived in which it is necessary to
  debruise supporters, as under no circumstances can these be the subject
  of a Royal Licence of this character, except in a possible case where
  they might have been granted as a simple augmentation to a man and his
  descendants, without further limitation. I know of no bastardised version
  consequent upon such a grant. <!-- Page 519 --><span class="pagenum" title="579.png"
  ><a name="page519"></a>{519}</span>Supporters signify some definite
  honour which cannot ordinarily survive illegitimacy.</p>

  <p>The bordure wavy is placed round the pronominal arms only, and no
  right to any quarterings the family may have enjoyed previously is
  conferred, except such right to a quarterly coat as might ensue through
  the assumption of a double name. Quartering is held to signify
  representation which cannot be given by a Royal Licence, but a quartering
  of augmentation or a duplicate coat for the pronominal name which had
  been so regularly used with the alternative coat as to constitute the two
  something in the nature of a compound coat, would be exemplified "all
  within a bordure wavy." Each illegitimate coat stands on its own basis,
  and there is a well-known instance in which a marriage was subsequently
  found to be illegal, or to have never taken place, after which, I
  believe, some number of brothers and sisters obtained Royal Licences and
  exemplifications. The descendants of one of the brothers will be found in
  the current Peerage Books, and those who know their peerage history well
  will recognise the case I allude to. All the brothers and sisters had the
  same arms exemplified, each with a bordure wavy <i>of a different
  colour</i>. If there were descendants of any of the sisters, those
  descendants would have been entitled to quarter the arms, because the
  illegitimacy made each sister an heiress for heraldic purposes. This is a
  curious anomaly, for had they been legitimate the descendants would have
  enjoyed no such right.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the mark of illegitimacy for the arms is the bordure
  compony, which is usually but not always indicative of the same. The
  bordure counter-compony has been occasionally stated to have the same
  character. This is hardly correct, though it may be so in a few isolated
  cases, but the bordure chequy has nothing whatever of an illegitimate
  character. It will be noticed that whilst the bordure compony and the
  bordure counter-company have their chequers or "panes," to use the
  heraldic term, following the outline of the shield, by lines parallel to
  those which mark its contour, the bordure chequy is drawn by lines
  parallel to and at right angles to the palar line of the shield,
  irrespective of its outline. A bordure chequy must, of course, at one
  point or another show three distinct rows of checks.</p>

  <p>The bastardising of crests even in England is a comparatively modern
  practice. I know of no single instance ancient or modern of the kind in
  Scottish heraldry, though I could mention scores of achievements in which
  the shields carry marks of distinction. This is valuable evidence, for no
  matter how lax the official practice of Scottish armory may have been at
  one period, the theory of Scottish armory far more nearly approaches the
  ancient practices and rules of heraldry <!-- Page 520 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="580.png"><a name="page520"></a>{520}</span>than
  does the armory of any other country. That theory is much nearer the
  ideal theory than the English one, but unfortunately for the practical
  purposes of modern heraldic needs, it does not answer so well. At the
  present day, therefore, a Scottish crest is not marked in any way.</p>

  <p>Most handbooks refer to a certain rule which is supposed to exist for
  the differencing of a coat to denote illegitimacy when the coat is that
  of the mother and not the father, the supposed method being to depict the
  arms under a surcoat, the result being much the same as if the whole of
  the arms appeared in exaggerated flaunches, the remainder of the shield
  being left vacant except for the tincture of the surcoat. As a matter of
  fact only one instance is known, and consequently we must consider it as
  a new coat devised to bear reference to the old one, and not as a
  regularised method of differencing for a particular set of
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>In Ireland the rules are to all intents and purposes the same as in
  England, with the exception of the occasional use of a sinister baton
  instead of a bendlet wavy sinister upon the crest. In Scotland, where
  Royal Licences are unknown, it is merely necessary to prove paternity,
  and rematriculate the arms with due and proper marks of distinction.</p>

  <p>It was a very general idea during a former period, but subsequently to
  the time when the bend and bendlet sinister and the bordure were
  recognised as in the nature of the accepted marks of bastardy, and when
  their penal nature was admitted, that whatever mark was adopted for the
  purpose of indicating illegitimacy need only be borne for three
  generations. Some of the older authorities tell us that after that length
  of time had elapsed it might be discarded, and some other and less
  objectionable mark be taken in its place. The older writers were
  striving, consciously or unconsciously, to reconcile the disgrace of
  illegitimacy, which they knew, with heraldic facts which they also knew,
  and to reconcile in certain prominent families undoubted illegitimacy
  with unmarked arms, the probability being that their sense of justice and
  regard for heraldry prompted them to the remark that some other mark of
  distinction <i>ought</i> to be added, whilst all the time they knew it
  never was. The arms of Byron, Somerset, Meinill, and Herbert are all
  cases where the marks of illegitimacy have been quietly dropped, entire
  reversion being had to the undifferenced original coat. At a time when
  marks of illegitimacy, both in fact and in theory, were nothing more than
  marks of cadency and difference from the arms of the head of the house,
  it was no venality of the heralds, but merely the acceptance of current
  ideas, that permitted them to recognise the undifferenced arms for the
  illegitimate descendants when there were no legitimate owners from whose
  claim the arms of the others needed <!-- Page 521 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="581.png"><a name="page521"></a>{521}</span>to be
  differentiated, and when lordships and lands had lapsed to a bastard
  branch. To this fact must be added another. The armorial control of the
  heralds after the days of tournaments was exercised through the
  Visitations and the Earl Marshal's Court. Peers were never subject to the
  Visitations, and so were not under control unless their arms were
  challenged in the Earl Marshal's Court by the rightful owner. The cases
  that were notorious are cases of the arms of peers.</p>

  <p>The Visitations gave the officers of arms greater control over the
  arms of Commoners than they had had theretofore, and the growing social
  opinions upon legitimacy and marriage brought social observances more
  into conformity with the technical law, and made that technical law of no
  inheritance and no paternity an operative fact. The result is that the
  hard legal fact is now rigidly and rightly insisted upon, and the claim
  and right to arms of one of illegitimate descent depends and is made to
  depend solely upon the instruments creating that right, and the
  conditions of "due and proper marks of distinction" always subject to
  which the right is called into being. Nowadays there is no release from
  the penalty of the bordures wavy and compony save through the avenue of a
  new and totally different grant and the full fees payable therefor. But,
  as the bearer of a bordure wavy once remarked to me, "I had rather
  descend illegitimately from a good family and bear their arms marked than
  descend from a lot of nobodies and use a new grant." But until the common
  law is altered, if it ever is, the game must be played fairly and the
  conditions of a Royal Licence observed, for the sins of the fathers are
  visited upon the children.</p>

  <p>Although I have refrained from giving any extended list of bastardised
  coats as examples of the rules for indicating illegitimacy, reference may
  nevertheless be made to various curious examples.</p>

  <p>The canton has occasionally been used. Sir John de Warren, a natural
  son of John, Earl of Surrey, Sussex, and Warenne (<i>d.</i> 1347), bore a
  canton of the arms of his mother, Alice de Nerford ["Gules, a lion
  rampant ermine"], over the chequy shield of Warren. A similar instance
  can be found in modern times, the arms of Charlton of Apley Castle, co.
  Salop, being bastardised by a sinister canton which bears two coats
  quarterly, these coats having formerly been quarterings borne in the
  usual manner.</p>

  <p>The custom of placing the paternal arms upon a bend has been
  occasionally adopted, but this of course is the creation of a <i>new</i>
  coat. It was followed by the Beauforts before their legitimation, and by
  Sir Roger de Clarendon, the illegitimate son of the Black Prince. The
  Somerset family, who derived illegitimately from the Beauforts, Dukes of
  Somerset, first debruised the Beaufort arms by <!-- Page 522 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="582.png"><a name="page522"></a>{522}</span>a
  bendlet sinister, but in the next generation the arms were placed upon a
  wide fess, this on a plain field of or. Although the Somersets, Dukes of
  Beaufort, have discarded all signs of bastardy from their shield, the
  version upon the fess was continued as one of the quarterings upon the
  arms of the old Shropshire family of Somerset Fox. One of the most
  curious bastardised coats is that of Henry Fitz-Roy, Duke of Richmond and
  Somerset, illegitimate son of Henry VIII. This shows the Royal Arms
  within a bordure quarterly ermine and counter-compony or and azure,
  debruised by a baton sinister argent, an inescutcheon quarterly gules and
  vairé, or and vert [possibly hinting at the Blount arms of his mother,
  barry nebuly or and sable], over all a lion rampant argent, on a chief
  azure a tower between two stags' heads caboshed argent, attired or. <!--

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXIII</h5>

<h5>THE MARSHALLING OF ARMS</h5>

  <p>The science of marshalling is the conjoining of two or more coats of
  arms upon one shield for the purpose of indicating sovereignty, dominion,
  alliance, descent, or pretension, according to recognised rules and
  regulations, by the employment of which the story of any given
  achievement shall be readily translatable.</p>

  <p>The methods of marshalling are (1) dimidiation, (2) impalement, (3)
  quartering, (4) superimposition.</p>

  <p>Instances of quartered shields are to be met with possibly before
  impalements or dimidiation. The earliest attempt at anything like a
  regularised method of procedure to signify marriage was that usually
  males <i>quartered</i> the arms of their wives or ancestresses from whom
  they acquired their lands; whilst impaled coats were to all intents and
  purposes the armorial bearings of married women, or more frequently of
  widows who took an immediate interest in their husbands' property. This
  ancient usage brings home very forcibly the former territorial connection
  of arms and land. The practice of the husband impaling the wife's arms,
  whether heiress or not, probably arose near the close of the fifteenth
  century. Even now it is laid down that the arms of a wife should not in
  general be borne upon the husband's banner, surcoat, or official
  seal.</p>

  <p>But impalement as we now know it was preceded by dimidiation.
  Dimidiation, which was but a short-lived method, was effected by the
  division of the shield down the centre. On the dexter side was placed the
  dexter half of the husband's arms, and on the sinister side was placed
  the sinister half of the wife's arms. With some coats of arms no
  objection could be urged against the employment of this method. But it
  was liable to result (<i>e.g.</i> with two coats of arms having the same
  ordinary) in the creation of a design which looked far more like one
  simple coat than a conjunction of two. The dimidiation of "argent, a bend
  gules" and "argent, a chevron sable" would simply result in a single coat
  "argent, a bend per pale gules and sable." This fault of the system must
  have made itself manifest at an early period, for we soon find it became
  customary to introduce about two-thirds of <!-- Page 524 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="584.png"><a name="page524"></a>{524}</span>the
  design of each coat for the sake of demonstrating their separate
  character. It must soon thereafter have become apparent that if
  two-thirds of the design of a coat of arms could be squeezed into half of
  the shield there was no valid reason why the whole of the design could
  not be employed. This therefore became customary under the name of
  impalement, and the practice has ever since remained with us. Few
  examples indeed of dimidiation are to be met with, and as a practical
  method of conjunction, the practice was chiefly in vogue during the
  earlier part of the fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>Occasionally quartered coats were dimidiated, in which case the first
  and third quarters of the husband's coat were conjoined with the second
  and fourth of the wife's. As far as outward appearance went, this
  practice resulted in the fact that no distinction existed from a plain
  quartered coat. Thus the seal of Margaret of Bavaria, Countess of
  Holland, and wife of John, Count de Nevers, in 1385 (afterwards Duke of
  Burgundy), bears a shield on which is apparently a simple instance of
  quartering, but really a dimidiated coat. The two coats to the dexter
  side of the palar line are: In chief Burgundy-Modern ("France-Ancient, a
  bordure compony argent and gules"), and in base Burgundy-Ancient. On the
  sinister side the coat in chief is Bavaria ("Bendy-lozengy argent and
  azure"); and the one in base contains the quartered arms of Flanders
  ("Or, a lion rampant sable"); and Holland ("Or, a lion rampant gules");
  the lines dividing these latter quarters being omitted, as is usually
  found to be the case with this particular shield.</p>

  <p>Certain examples can be found amongst the Royal Arms in England which
  show much earlier instances of dimidiation. The arms of Margaret of
  France, who died in 1319, the second queen of Edward I., as they remain
  on her tomb in Westminster Abbey, afford an example of this method of
  conjunction. The arms of England appear on the dexter side of the
  escocheon; and this coat undergoes a certain amount of curtailment,
  though the dimidiation is not complete, portions only of the hindmost
  parts of the lions being cut off by the palar line. The coat of France,
  on the sinister side, of course does not readily indicate the
  dimidiation.</p>

  <p>Boutell, in his chapter on marshalling in "Heraldry, Historical and
  Popular," gives several early examples of dimidiation. The seal of Edmond
  Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall (<i>d.</i> 1300), bears his arms (those of
  Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and King of the Romans) dimidiating those of
  his wife, Margaret de Clare. Here only the sinister half of his bordure
  is removed, while the Clare coat ("Or, three chevrons gules") is entirely
  dimidiated, and the chevrons are little distinguishable from bends. Both
  coats are dimidiated in other examples mentioned <!-- Page 525 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="585.png"><a name="page525"></a>{525}</span>by
  Boutell, viz. William de Valence and his wife, and Alianore Montendre and
  her husband Guy Ferre. On the seal of Margaret Campbell, wife of
  Alexander Napier, in 1531, the shield shows upon the dexter side the arms
  of Lennox, and on the sinister the dimidiated coat (the sinister half of
  the quartered arms) of Campbell and Lorn. This results in the galley of
  Lorn being in chief, and the Campbell gyrons in base.</p>

  <p>An early and interesting Irish example of this kind of marshalling is
  afforded by a dimidiated coat of Clare and Fitzgerald, which now figures
  on the official seal of the Provosts of Youghal (Clare: "Or, three
  chevrons gules." Fitzgerald: "Argent, a saltire gules, with a label of
  five points in chief"). Both these coats are halved. They result from the
  marriage of Richard Clare, Earl of Hertford, with Juliana, daughter and
  heir of Maurice Fitzgerald, feudal lord of Inchiquin and Youghal.</p>

  <p>An even more curious case of dimidiation comes to light in the arms
  formerly used by the Abbey of St. Etienne at Caen, in which the arms of
  England and those attributed to the Duchy of Normandy ("Gules, two lions
  passant guardant or") were dimidiated, so that in the former half three
  of the fore-quarters of the lions appear, while in the sinister half only
  two of the hind-quarters are represented.</p>

  <p>Dimidiation was not always effected by conjunction down the palar
  line, other partition lines of the shield being occasionally, though very
  rarely, employed in this manner.</p>

  <p>Certain curious (now indivisible) coats of arms remain which
  undoubtedly originated in the dimidiation of two separate coats,
  <i>e.g.</i> the arms of Yarmouth, Sandwich, Hastings, Rye, and Chester.
  In all cases some Royal connection can be traced which has caused the
  Royal Arms of England to be conjoined with the earlier devices of fish,
  ships, or garbs which had been employed by the towns in question. It is
  worth the passing thought, however, whether the conjoined lions and hulks
  used by the Cinque Ports may not originally have been a device of the
  Sovereign for naval purposes, or possibly the naval version of the Royal
  Arms (see page <a href="#page182">182</a>).</p>

  <p>One other remainder from the practice of dimidiation still survives
  amongst the presently existing rules of heraldry. It is a rule to which
  no modern authoritative exception can be mentioned. When a coat within a
  bordure is impaled with another coat, the bordure is not continued down
  the centre of the shield, but stops short at top and bottom when the
  palar line is reached. This rule is undoubtedly a result of the ancient
  method of conjunction by dimidiation, but the curious point is that, at
  the period when dimidiation was employed and during the period which
  followed, some number of examples can be <!-- Page 526 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="586.png"><a name="page526"></a>{526}</span>found
  where the bordure is continued round the whole coat which is within
  it.</p>

  <p>The arms of man and wife are now conjoined according to the following
  rules:&mdash;If the wife is not an heraldic heiress the two coats are
  impaled. If the wife be an heraldic heir or coheir, in lieu of impalement
  the arms of her family are placed on an inescutcheon superimposed on the
  centre of her husband's arms, the inescutcheon being termed an escutcheon
  of pretence, because <i>jure uxoris</i> she being an heiress of her
  house, the husband "pretends" to the representation of her family.</p>

  <p>For heraldic purposes it therefore becomes necessary to define the
  terms heir and heiress. It is very essential that the point should be
  thoroughly understood, because quarterings other than those of
  augmentation can only be inherited from or through female ancestors who
  are in themselves heirs or coheirs (this is the true term, or, rather,
  the ancient term, though they are now usually referred to colloquially as
  heiresses or coheiresses) in blood, or whose issue subsequently become in
  a later generation the representatives of any ancestor in the male line
  of that female ancestor. A woman is an "heir" or "heiress" (1) if she is
  an only child; (2) if all her brothers die without leaving any issue to
  survive, either male or female; (3) she becomes an heiress "in her
  issue," as it is termed, if she die leaving issue herself if and when all
  the descendants male and female of her brothers become absolutely
  extinct. The term "coheir" or "coheiress" is employed in cases similar to
  the foregoing when, instead of one daughter, there are two or more.</p>

  <p>No person can be "heir" or "coheir" of another person until the latter
  is dead, though he or she may be heir-apparent or heir-presumptive.
  Though the word "heir" is frequently used with regard to material
  matters, such usage is really there incorrect, except in cases of
  intestacy. A person benefiting under a will is a legatee of money, or a
  devisee of land, and not an heir to either. The table on page <a
  href="#page527">527</a> may make things a little clearer, but in the
  following remarks intestacy is ignored, and the explanations apply solely
  to <i>heirship of blood</i>.</p>

  <p>Charles in the accompanying pedigree is, after 1800, <i>heir</i> of
  David. Thomas is <i>heir-apparent</i> of Charles, being a son and the
  eldest born. He dies <i>v.p.</i> (<i>vita patris</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in the
  lifetime of his father) and never becomes heir. A daughter can never
  become an heir-apparent, as there is always, during the lifetime of her
  father, the possibility of a son being born. Mary, Ellen, and Blanche are
  coheirs of Thomas their father, whom they survive, and they are also
  coheirs of their grandfather Charles, to whom they succeed, and they
  would properly in a pedigree be described as both. They are heirs-general
  of Thomas, Charles, and David, and, being the heirs of the senior line,
  they are heirs-general or coheirs-general of their house. David being
  possessed of the barony "by writ" of Cilfowyr, it would "fall into
  abeyance" at the death of Charles between the three daughters
  equally.</p>

  <p>In Scotland Mary, Ellen, and Blanche would be termed "heirs
  portioners," and Mary, being an heiress and the eldest born in the direct
  and senior line, would be termed the "heir of line." David being
  possessed of an ancient Scottish peerage not limited to males (the
  Earldom of Edinburgh), Mary, the heir of line, would at once succeed in
  her own right as Countess of Edinburgh on the death of her grandfather
  Charles. If the family were an untitled Scottish family entitled to
  supporters, these would descend to Mary unless they had been specifically
  granted with some other limitation.</p>

  <p>At the death of Thomas in 1830 Edmond becomes heir male apparent, and
  at the death of his father in 1840 Edmond becomes heir male of his house
  until his death. David having been created a peer (Duke of London) with
  remainder to the heirs male of his body, Edmond succeeded as Duke of
  London at the death of Charles in 1840. Grace and Muriel are coheirs of
  Edmond after his death. They are <i>not</i> either coheirs or
  heirs-general of Charles, in spite of the fact that their father was his
  heir male. At the death of Charles in 1840, when Edmond succeeded as heir
  male, John succeeded as heir male presumptive to Edmond. He was not
  heir-apparent, because a son might at any moment have been born to
  Edmond. An heir-apparent and an heir-presumptive cannot exist at the same
  time, for whilst there is an heir-apparent there cannot be an
  heir-presumptive. John succeeded as heir male of his house, and therefore
  as Duke of London, in 1850, at the death of his elder brother Edmond;
  but, though John was the "heir male" of his said elder brother, he was
  <i>not</i> his "heir" (Grace and Muriel being the coheirs of Edmond), nor
  was he the "heir male of the body" of Edmond, not being descended from
  him. John, however, was "heir male of the body" of Charles. George is
  heir-apparent of John until his death in 1870, when George succeeds as
  "heir" of his father and heir male of his house, and consequently Duke of
  London. At his death in 1880 Dorothy becomes the "sole heir," or, more
  properly, the "sole heir-general," of her father George; but his kinsman
  Robert becomes his "heir male," and therefore Duke of London, in spite of
  the fact that there was a much nearer male relative, viz. a nephew,
  Arthur, the son of his sister. Robert also becomes the heir male of the
  body of Owen and heir male of his house, and as such Duke of London. He
  would also be generally described as the heir male of the body of
  David.</p>

  <p>At the death of Dorothy in 1885 her coheirs were her aunt Alice and
  her cousin Arthur equally, and though these really were the coheirs <!--
  Page 529 --><span class="pagenum" title="589.png"><a
  name="page529"></a>{529}</span>of <i>Dorothy</i> (the claims of Alice and
  Annie being equal, and the rights of Annie having devolved upon Arthur),
  they would more usually be found described as the coheirs of George or of
  John. Annie was never <i>herself</i> really a coheir, because she died
  before her brother, but "in her issue" she became the coheir of Dorothy,
  though she would, after 1885, be usually described as "in her issue" a
  coheir of George, or possibly even of John, though this would be an
  inexact description. Arthur was heir of his mother after 1870, heir of
  his father after 1872, and heir-apparent of his father before that date;
  after 1885 he is a coheir of Dorothy, and after 1887 sole heir of Dorothy
  and sole heir of Alice. He would also be usually described as
  heir-general of George, and heir-general of John. Let us suppose that
  John had married Edith Torkington, an English baroness (<i>suo jure</i>)
  by writ (Baroness Neville), who had died in 1862. At that date the barony
  would have descended to her eldest son George until his death in 1880,
  when Dorothy, <i>suo jure</i>, would have succeeded. At her death in 1885
  the barony would have fallen into abeyance between Alice and Arthur. At
  the death of Alice in 1887 the abeyance would be at an end, and the
  barony in its entirety would have devolved upon Arthur, who would have
  enjoyed it until at his death in 1888 the barony would have again fallen
  into abeyance between Maria, Jane, and Hannah equally. It is not unlikely
  that Her Majesty might have "determined the abeyance," or "called the
  barony out of abeyance" (the meanings of the terms are identical) in
  favour of Maria, who would consequently have enjoyed the barony in its
  entirety. At her death in 1889 it would again fall into abeyance between
  Jane and Hannah. At Jane's death in 1890 Hannah became sole heir, and the
  abeyance came to an end when Hannah succeeded to the barony. At her death
  it would pass to her aunt Lilian. Hannah would usually be described as
  "coheir and subsequently sole heir of" Arthur. If the Baroness Neville
  had been possessed of an ancient Scottish Peerage (the Earldom of
  Torkington) it would have passed undividedly and in full enjoyment to the
  heir of line, <i>i.e.</i> in 1862 to George, 1880 to Dorothy, 1885 to
  Alice, 1887 to Arthur, 1888 to Maria, 1889 to Jane, 1890 to Hannah, and
  1896 to Lilian, the last (shown on the pedigree) in remainder. Lilian
  does not become an heiress until 1896, when the whole issue of her
  brother becomes extinct. Irene and Isabel never become heirs at all.</p>

  <p>Robert, as we have seen, became heir male of his house and Duke of
  London in 1880. At his death (1896) Harriet becomes sole heir of Robert,
  but at her death in 1897 his niece Ada, the only child of his younger
  brother Philip, who had predeceased him, would be usually referred to as
  heir of Robert, whilst Cecil is heir male of his house. <!-- Page 530
  --><span class="pagenum" title="590.png"><a
  name="page530"></a>{530}</span></p>

  <p>When the term "of the body" is employed, <i>actual descent</i> from
  that person is signified, <i>e.g.</i> Arthur after 1885 is "collateral"
  heir-general of Dorothy, but "heir-general of the body" of Edith
  Torkington.</p>

  <p>An "heir of entail," or, to use the Scottish term, the "heir of
  tailzie," is merely the person succeeding to <i>property</i> under a
  specific remainder contained in a deed of entail. This has no relation to
  heirship in blood, and the term, from an armorial point of view, might be
  entirely disregarded, were it not that some number of Scottish coats of
  arms, and a greater number of Scottish supporters, and some Scottish
  peerages and baronetcies, are specifically granted and limited to the
  heirs of entail. There are a few similar English grants following upon
  Royal Licences for change of name and arms.</p>

  <p>The term "heir in expectancy" is sometimes heard, but it is not really
  a proper term, and has no exact or legal meaning. When George was alive
  his daughter Dorothy was his heir-presumptive, but supposing that Dorothy
  were a Catholic nun and Alice a lunatic, in each of which cases there
  would be very little likelihood of any marriage ever taking place, Arthur
  would very generally be described as "heir in expectancy," for though he
  was neither heir-apparent nor heir-presumptive, all probability pointed
  to the eventual succession of himself or his issue.</p>

  <p>Anybody is said to be "in remainder" to entailed property or a peerage
  if he is included within the recited limits of the entail or peerage. The
  "heir in remainder" is the person next entitled to succeed after the
  death of the existing holder.</p>

  <p>Thus (excluding heirs in expectancy and women who are <!-- Page 531
  --><span class="pagenum" title="591.png"><a
  name="page531"></a>{531}</span>heirs-presumptive) a marriage with any
  woman who is an heir or coheir results in her arms being placed upon an
  escutcheon of pretence over the arms of the husband. In the cases of all
  other women the arms are "impaled" only. To "impale two coats" the shield
  is divided by a straight line down the centre, the whole design of the
  arms of the husband being placed on the dexter side of the escutcheon,
  and the whole design of the wife's arms being placed on the sinister side
  (Fig. 742).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/fig745.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig745.png"
      alt="Fig. 745." title="Fig. 745." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 745.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>It may perhaps be as well to here exemplify the different methods of
  the conjunction of the arms of man and wife, arranging the same two coats
  in the different methods in which they might be marshalled before
  reverting to ancient practices.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/fig746.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig746.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 746.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>An ordinary commoner impales his wife's arms as in Fig. 742. If she be
  an heiress, he places them on an escutcheon of pretence as in Fig. 743.
  If the husband, not being a Knight, is, however, a Companion of an Order
  of Knighthood, this does not (except in the case of the Commanders of the
  Victorian Order) give him the right to use the circle of his Order round
  his arms, and his badge is simply hung below the escutcheon, the arms of
  the wife being impaled or placed on an escutcheon of pretence thereupon
  as the case may necessitate. The wife of a Knight Bachelor shares the
  state and rank with her husband, and the only difference is in the helmet
  (Fig. 744). But if the husband be a knight of any order, the ensigns of
  that order are personal to himself, and cannot be shared with his wife,
  and consequently two shields are employed. On the dexter shield are the
  arms of the husband with the circle of his order of knighthood, and on
  the sinister shield are the arms of the husband impaling the arms of the
  wife. Some meaningless decoration, usually a wreath of oak-leaves, is
  placed round the sinister shield to "balance," from the artistic point,
  the <!-- Page 532 --><span class="pagenum" title="592.png"><a
  name="page532"></a>{532}</span>ribbon, or the ribbon and collar, as the
  case may be, of the order of knighthood of the husband (Fig. 745). A
  seeming exception to this rule in the case of the recent warrant to Queen
  Alexandra, whose arms, impaled by those of His Majesty, are depicted
  impaled within the Garter, is perhaps explained by the fact that Her
  Majesty is herself a member of that Order. A Knight Grand Cross, of
  course, adds his collar to the dexter shield, and if he has supporters,
  these are placed outside the <i>two</i> shields.</p>

  <p>A peer impales the arms of his wife as in the case of a commoner, the
  arms of the wife being, of course, under the protection of the
  supporters, coronet, and helmet of the peer (Fig. 746). If, in addition
  to being a peer, he is also a knight of an order, he follows the rules
  which prescribe the use of two shields as already described.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:33%;">

  </div>

  <p>Supposing the wife to be a peeress in her own right, she cannot
  nowadays confer any rank whatever upon her husband; consequently, if she
  marry a commoner, the husband places her arms upon an escutcheon of
  pretence surmounted by a coronet of her rank, but the supporters
  belonging to her peerage cannot be added to his shield. The arms of the
  wife are consequently repeated alone, but in this case upon a lozenge on
  the sinister side of the husband's shield. Above this lozenge is placed
  the coronet of her rank, and the supporters belonging to her peerage are
  placed on either side of the lozenge (Fig. 747). But the arms of a
  peeress in her own right are frequently represented on a lozenge without
  any reference to the arms of her husband. In the case of a peeress in her
  own right marrying a peer, the arms of the peeress are placed upon an
  escutcheon of pretence in the centre of <!-- Page 533 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="593.png"><a name="page533"></a>{533}</span>her
  husband's shield, the only difference being that this escutcheon of
  pretence is surmounted by the coronet belonging to the peerage of the
  wife; and on the sinister side the arms of the wife are repeated upon a
  lozenge with the supporters and coronet belonging to her own peerage. It
  is purely an artistic detail, but it is a happy conceit in such an
  instance to join together the compartments upon which the two pairs of
  supporters stand to emphasise the fact that the whole is in reality but
  one achievement (Fig. 748).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:13%;">
      <a href="images/fig749.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig749.png"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 749.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>Now, it is not uncommon to see an achievement displayed in this
  manner, for there have been several instances in recent years of
  peeresses in their own right who have married peers. Every woman who
  <i>inherits</i> a peerage must of necessity be an heir or coheir, and, as
  will have been seen, the laws of armory provide for this circumstance;
  but supposing that the peeress were a peeress by creation and were not an
  heiress, how would her arms be displayed? Apparently it would not be
  permissible to place them on an escutcheon of pretence, and consequently
  there is no way upon the husband's shield of showing that his wife is a
  peeress in her own right. Such an instance did arise in the case of the
  late Baroness Stratheden, who was created a peeress whilst not being an
  heiress. Her husband was subsequently created Baron Campbell. Now, how
  were the arms of Lord Campbell and Lady Stratheden and Campbell
  displayed? I think I am correct in saying that not a single textbook on
  armory recites the method which should be employed, and I candidly
  confess that I myself am quite ignorant upon the point.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:14%;">
      <a href="images/fig750.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig750.png"
      alt="Fig. 750." title="Fig. 750." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 750.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>All the foregoing are simply instances of how to display the arms of
  man and wife, or, to speak more correctly, they are instances of the
  methods <i>in which a man should bear arms for himself and his wife when
  he is married</i>; for the helmet and mantling clearly indicate that it
  is the man's coat of arms, and not the woman's. In olden days, when the
  husband possessed everything, this might have been enough for all the
  circumstances which were likely to occur.</p>

  <p>A lady whilst unmarried bears arms on a lozenge (Fig. 749), and upon
  becoming a widow, bears again upon a lozenge the arms of her husband
  impaled with the arms borne by her father (Fig. 750), or with the latter
  upon an escutcheon of pretence if the widow be herself an <!-- Page 534
  --><span class="pagenum" title="594.png"><a
  name="page534"></a>{534}</span>heiress (Fig. 751). The widow of a knight
  has no way whatever of indicating that her husband was of higher rank
  than an ordinary untitled gentleman. The widow of a baronet, however,
  places the inescutcheon with the hand of Ulster upon her husband's arms
  (Fig. 752). I have often heard this disputed, but a reference to the
  Grant Books at the College of Arms (<i>vide</i> a grant of arms some
  years ago to Lady Pearce) will provide the necessary precedent. If,
  however, the baronetcy is of Nova Scotia, this means of indicating the
  rank cannot be employed. The widow of a peer (not being a peeress in her
  own right) uses a lozenge of her husband's and her own arms, with his
  supporters and his coronet (Fig. 753).</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:15%;">

  <p>If a peeress, after marriage with a commoner, becomes a widow she
  bears on the dexter side a lozenge of her late husband's arms and
  superimposed thereupon her own on an escutcheon of pretence surmounted by
  a coronet. (The coronet, it should be noted, is over the escutcheon of
  pretence and not above the lozenge.) On the sinister side she bears a
  lozenge of her own arms alone with her supporters and with her coronet
  above the lozenge. The arms of the present Baroness Kinloss would show an
  example of such an arrangement of two lozenges, but as Lady Kinloss does
  not possess supporters these additions could not be introduced.</p>

  <p>The laws of arms provide no way in which a married woman (other than a
  peeress in her own right) can display arms in her own right during the
  lifetime of her husband, unless this is to be presumed from the method of
  depicting the arms of a wife upon a hatchment. In such a case, a
  <i>shield</i> is used, usually suspended from a ribbon, identical with
  the shield of the husband, but omitting the helmet, crest, mantling, and
  motto.</p>

  <p>Impalement is used occasionally in other circumstances than marriage,
  <i>i.e.</i> to effect conjunction of official and personal arms.</p>

  <p>With rare exceptions, the official arms which exist are those of
  Archiepiscopal and Episcopal Sees, of the Kings of Arms, and of the <!--
  Page 535 --><span class="pagenum" title="595.png"><a
  name="page535"></a>{535}</span>Regius Professors at Cambridge. Here
  certainly, in the ecclesiastical cases, the theory of marriage remains,
  the official arms being placed on the dexter side and the personal arms
  on the sinister, inasmuch as the laws of armory for ecclesiastics were
  made at a time when the clergy were celibate. The personal helmet and
  crest are placed above the impaled coat, except in the cases of bishops
  and archbishops, who, of course, use a mitre in place thereof. It is not
  correct to impale the arms of a wife upon the same shield which carries
  the impalement of an official coat of arms, because the wife does not
  share the office. In such a case it is necessary to make use of two
  shields placed side by side, as is done in conjoining the arms of a
  Knight of any Order with those of his wife.</p>

  <p>In impaling the arms of a wife, it is not correct to impale more than
  her pronominal coat. This is a definite rule in England, somewhat
  modified in Scotland, as will be presently explained. Though it has never
  been considered good form to impale a quartered shield, it is only
  recently that the real fact that such a proceeding is definitely
  incorrect has come to light. It appears from the State Papers, Domestic
  Series, Eliz. xxvi. 31, 1561:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"At a Chapitre holden by the office of Armes at the Embroyderers' Hall
  in London, anno 4<sup>o</sup> Reginæ Elizabethæ it was agreed that no
  inhiritrix eyther mayde wife or widow should bear or cause to be borne
  any Creast or cognizance of her Ancestors otherwise than as followeth. If
  she be unmarried to bear in her ringe, cognizaunce or otherwise, the
  first coate of her ancestors in a Lozenge. And during her widowhood to
  set the first coate of her husbande in pale with the first coate of her
  Auncestors. And if she mary on who is noe gentleman, then she to be
  clearly exempted from the former conclusion."</p>

  <p>Whilst this rule holds in England, it must, to a certain extent, be
  modified in relation to the arms of a Scottish wife. Whilst the
  inalienable right <i>to quarter arms derived</i> from an heiress cannot
  be said to be non-existent in Scotland, it should be noted that the
  custom of indiscriminately quartering is much less frequent than in
  England, and comparatively seldom adopted, unless estates, or chief
  representation in an important or appreciable degree, follow the
  technical heraldic representation. In England the claim is always
  preferred to quarter the arms of an ancestress who had no brothers
  whether she transmitted estates or not. Of course, technically and
  theoretically the claim is perfectly correct, and cannot, and should not,
  be denied. But in practice in England it has in some cases reached a
  rather absurd extent, when a man on marrying an only daughter of the
  youngest son of the youngest branch of a family consequently acquires the
  right to display with his own ensigns the full arms and quarterings of
  <!-- Page 536 --><span class="pagenum" title="596.png"><a
  name="page536"></a>{536}</span>the head of a house from which he has
  inherited no lands, and which is still thriving in the senior male line.
  In Scottish practice such an event would be ignored, and in that country
  it is not usual to add quarterings to a shield, <i>nor are these
  officially recognised</i> without a rematriculation of the arms. In
  England it is merely a question of recording the pedigree and proving
  heirship, and many quarterings are proved and recorded that there is not
  the slightest intention to use regularly. Rematriculation has a more
  permanent character than mere registration, inasmuch as the coat with its
  quarterings upon matriculation as far as usage is concerned becomes
  indivisible, and, consequently, for a Scottish wife the impalement should
  be of the indivisible arms and quarterings matriculated to her father in
  Lyon Register, with his bordure and other "difference" marks.</p>

  <p>All the old armorists provide ways of impaling the arms of several
  wives, and consequently the idea has grown up that it is permissible and
  correct to bear and use the arms of two wives at the same time. This is a
  mistake, because, strictly and technically speaking, the right to impale
  the arms of a wife ceases at her death. Impalement means marriage, and
  when the marriage is dissolved the impalement becomes meaningless, and
  should be discontinued. A man cannot be married to two people at one
  time, nor can he as a consequence impale two coats of arms at the same
  time.</p>

  <p>The matter is more clearly apparent if the question of an escutcheon
  of pretence be considered in place of an impalement. The escutcheon of
  pretence means that the husband <i>pretends</i> to represent the family
  of his wife. This <i>jure uxoris</i> he undoubtedly does whilst she is
  alive, but the moment she dies the <i>actual</i> representation of her
  family passes to her son and heir, and it is ridiculous for her husband
  to <i>pretend</i> to represent when there is an undoubted representative
  in existence, and when the representation, such as it was when vested in
  himself, has come to an end, and passed elsewhere. If his heiress-wife
  had been a peeress, he would have borne her escutcheon of pretence
  surmounted by her coronet; but it is ridiculous for him to continue to do
  so when the right to the coronet and to the peerage has passed to his
  wife's heir. The same argument holds good with regard to impalement.
  That, of course, raises the point that in every authority (particularly
  in those of an earlier period) will be found details of the methods to be
  adopted for impaling the arms of several wives. People have quite failed
  to appreciate the object of these rules. Armory from its earliest
  introduction has had great memorial use, and when a monument or hatchment
  is put up to a man it has been usual, prior to these utilitarian days of
  funeral reform, to memorialise <i>all</i> the wives he has been possessed
  of. In the same way, in a pedigree it is necessary to <!-- Page 537
  --><span class="pagenum" title="597.png"><a
  name="page537"></a>{537}</span>enumerate the names and arms of all the
  wives of a man. Consequently for tombs and pedigrees&mdash;when all being
  dead, there is no reason to indicate any particular woman as the present
  <i>wife</i>&mdash;plans have been devised for the combination of several
  coats into one memorial achievement, plans necessitated by the
  circumstances of the cases, and plans to which no objection can be taken.
  Tombs, pedigrees, and other memorials are the usual form in which the
  records of arms have chiefly come down to us, and from the frequency in
  which cases of achievements with double impalements have been preserved,
  a mistaken idea has arisen that it is correct to bear, and actually use
  and carry, two impalements at one and the same time. Outside memorial
  instances, I have utterly failed to find any instance in former days of a
  man himself using in his own lifetime two impalements, and I believe and
  state it to be absolutely incorrect for a man to use, say on a carriage,
  a bookplate, or a seal, the arms of a deceased wife. You may <i>have
  been</i> married to a presently deceased woman, therefore impale her arms
  in a record or memorial; but no one <i>is</i> married to a deceased
  woman, therefore it is wrong to advertise that you are married to her by
  impaling her arms; and as you cannot be married to two people at the same
  time, it is illogical and wrong to <i>use</i> or carry two impalements. I
  know of no instance of a grant to a man of arms to bear in right of a
  deceased wife. It is for these occasions of memorial and record that
  methods have been devised to show a man's marriage with several wives.
  They certainly were not devised for the purpose of enabling him to bear
  and use for contemporary purposes the arms of a series of dead women, the
  representation of whom is no longer vested in himself.</p>

  <p>Whilst admitting that for the purposes of record or memorial rules
  <i>do</i> exist, it should at the same time be pointed out that even for
  such occasions it is much more usual to see two shields displayed, each
  carrying its separate impalement, than to find two impalements on one
  shield. The use of a separate shield for each marriage is the method that
  I would strongly advocate, but as a knowledge of past observances must be
  had fully, if one is to read aright the records of the tombs, I recite
  what the rules are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) <i>To impale the arms of two wives.</i>&mdash;Either the husband's
  arms are placed in the centre, with the first wife on the dexter and the
  second wife on the sinister, or else the husband's arms are placed on the
  dexter side, and the sinister side is divided in fess, the arms of the
  first wife being placed in chief and those of the second in base. The
  former method is the one more generally employed of the two.</p>

  <p>(2) <i>Three wives.</i>&mdash;Husband's arms in centre, first wife's
  on dexter side, second wife's on sinister side in chief, and third wife
  in base. <!-- Page 538 --><span class="pagenum" title="598.png"><a
  name="page538"></a>{538}</span></p>

  <p>(3) <i>Four wives.</i>&mdash;Husband's in centre, first and second
  wives' in chief and base respectively on the dexter side, and third and
  fourth similarly on the sinister.</p>

  <p>If one of two wives be an heiress her arms might be found in pretence
  and the other coat or coats impaled, but it is impossible in such a case
  to place a number to the wife, and it is impossible to display an
  escutcheon of pretence for more than one wife, as if the escutcheon of
  pretence is removed from the exact centre it at once ceases to be an
  escutcheon of pretence. Consequently, if more than one wife be an
  heiress, separate escutcheons should be used for each marriage. Plans
  have been drawn up and apparently accepted providing for wives up to
  nearly twenty in number, but no useful purpose will be served by
  repeating them. A man with more than four wives is unusual in this
  country.</p>

  <p>Divorce nullifies marriage, and both husband and wife must at once
  revert to bachelor and maiden achievements respectively.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to deduce any certain conclusions as to the ancient
  rules connected with impalement, for a simple reason which becomes very
  noticeable on an examination of ancient <i>seals</i> and other armorial
  records. In early times there can be no doubt whatever that men did not
  impale, or bother about the arms of wives who were not great heiresses. A
  man bore his own arms, and he left his father-in-law, or his
  brother-in-law, to bear those of the family with which he had matched. Of
  course, we find many cases in which the arms of a wife figure upon the
  husband's shield, but a careful examination of them shows that in
  practically every case the reason is to be found in the fact that the
  wife was an heiress. Husbands were called to Parliament in virtue of the
  peerages vested in their wives, and we cannot but come to the conclusion
  that whenever one finds use in early times of the arms of a wife, it is
  due to the fact that the husband was bearing them not because of his mere
  marriage, but because he was enjoying the estates, or peerage, of his
  wife.</p>

  <p>For that reason we find in many cases the arms of the wife borne in
  preference to the paternal arms of descent, or meet with them quartered
  with the arms of the husband, and frequently being given precedence over
  his own; and on the analogy of the coats of arms of wives at present
  borne with the wife's surname by the husband under Royal Licence, there
  can be little doubt that at a period when Royal Licences had not come
  into regular vogue the same idea was dominant, and the appearance of a
  wife's coat of arms meant the assumption of those arms by the husband as
  his own, with or without the surname of the wife.</p>

  <p>The connection between name and arms was not then so stereotyped as it
  is at present; rather was it a connection between arms and <!-- Page 539
  --><span class="pagenum" title="599.png"><a
  name="page539"></a>{539}</span>land, and perhaps more pointedly of arms
  and a peerage title where this existed, for there are many points and
  many facts which conclusively show that at an early period a coat of arms
  was often considered to have a territorial limitation; or perhaps it
  should be said that, whilst admittedly personal, arms have territorial
  attributes or connection.</p>

  <p>This is borne out by the pleadings and details remaining to us
  concerning the Grey and Hastings controversy, and if this territorial
  character of a coat of arms is admitted, together with another
  characteristic no less important&mdash;and certainly equally
  accepted&mdash;that a coat of arms could belong to but one person at the
  same time, it must be recognised that the appearance of a wife's arms on
  a husband's shield is not an instance of a sign of mere marriage or
  anything analogous thereto. But when we turn to the arms of women, the
  condition of affairs is wholly reversed. A woman, who of course retained
  her identity, drew her position from her marriage and from her husband's
  position, and from the very earliest period we find that whilst a man
  simply bore his own arms, the wife upon her seal displayed both the arms
  of her own family and the arms of her husband's. Until a much later
  period it cannot be said to have been ordinarily customary for the
  husband to bear the arms of his wife unless she were an heiress, but from
  almost the beginning of armory the wife conjoined the arms of her husband
  and herself. But the instances which have come down to us from an early
  period of dimidiated or impaled coats are chiefly instances of the
  display of arms by a widow.</p>

  <p>The methods of conjunction which can be classed as above, however, at
  first seem to have been rather varied.</p>

  <p>Originally separate shields were employed for the different coats of
  arms, then dimidiated examples occur; at a later period we find the arms
  impaled upon one shield, and at a subsequent date the escutcheon of
  pretence comes into use as a means of indicating that the wife was an
  heiress.</p>

  <p>The origin of this escutcheon is easy to understand. Taking arms to
  have a territorial limitation&mdash;a point which still finds a certain
  amount of acceptance in Scottish heraldry&mdash;there was no doubt that a
  man, in succeeding to a lordship in right of his wife, would wish to bear
  the arms associated therewith. He placed them, therefore, upon his own,
  and arms exclusively of a territorial character have certainly very
  frequently been placed "in pretence." His own arms he would look upon as
  arms of descent; they consequently occupied the field of his shield. The
  lordship of his wife he did not enjoy through descent, and consequently
  he would naturally incline to place it "in pretence," and from the
  constant occasions in which such a proceeding would seem to be the
  natural course of events (all of which occasions <!-- Page 540 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="600.png"><a name="page540"></a>{540}</span>would
  be associated with an heiress-wife), one would be led to the conclusion
  that such a form of display indicated an heiress-wife; and consequently
  the rule deduced, as are all heraldic rules, from past precedents became
  established.</p>

  <p>In the next generation, the son and heir would have descent from his
  mother equally with his father, and the arms of her family would be
  equally arms of descent to him, and no longer the mere territorial emblem
  of a lordship. Consequently they became on the same footing as the arms
  of his father. The son would naturally, therefore, quarter the arms. The
  escutcheon of pretence being removed, and therefore having enjoyed but a
  temporary existence, the association thereof with the heiress-wife
  becomes emphasised in a much greater degree.</p>

  <p>This is now accepted as a definite rule of armory, but in reciting it
  as a rule it should be pointed out, first, that no man may place the arms
  of his wife upon an escutcheon of pretence during the lifetime of her
  father, because whilst her father is alive there is always the
  opportunity of a re-marriage, and of the consequent birth of a son and
  heir. No man is compelled to bear arms on an escutcheon of pretence, it
  being quite correct to impale them merely to indicate the
  marriage&mdash;if he so desires. There are many cases of arms which would
  appear meaningless and undecipherable when surmounted by an escutcheon of
  pretence.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes, also (says Guillim), he who marries an heretrix may carry
  her arms in an inescutcheon upon his own, because the husband pretends
  that his heirs shall one day inherit an estate by her; it is therefore
  called an escutcheon of pretence; but this way of bearing is not known
  abroad upon that occasion."</p>

  <p>A man on marrying an heiress-wife has no great space at his disposal
  for the display of her arms, and though it is now considered perfectly
  correct to place any number of quarterings upon an escutcheon of
  pretence, the opportunity does not in fact exist for more than the
  display of a limited number. In practice, three or four are as many as
  will usually be found, but theoretically it is correct to place the whole
  of the quarterings to which the wife is entitled upon the escutcheon of
  pretence.</p>

  <p>Two early English instances may be pointed out in the fifteenth
  century, in which a husband placed his wife's arms <i>en surtout</i>.
  These are taken from the Garter Plates of Sir John Neville, Lord Montagu,
  afterwards Marquess of Montagu (elected K.G. <i>circa</i> 1463), and of
  Richard Beauchamp, fifth Earl of Warwick and Albemarle (elected K.G.
  <i>circa</i> 1400); but it was not until about the beginning of the
  seventeenth century that the regular practice arose by which the husband
  of an heiress places his wife's arms in an escutcheon <i>en surtout</i>
  <!-- Page 541 --><span class="pagenum" title="601.png"><a
  name="page541"></a>{541}</span>upon his personal arms, whether his coat
  be a quartered one or not. Another early instance is to be found in Fig.
  754, which is interesting as showing the arms of both wives of the first
  Earl of Shrewsbury. His first was <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Furnivall. Her
  arms are, however, impaled. His second wife was the daughter (but not the
  heir) of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, but she was coheir of her
  mother, the Baroness Lisle.</p>

  4, gules, a lion passant guardant argent, crowned or (Lisle); 2 and 3,
  argent, a chevron gules (Tyes). (From MS. Reg. 15, E. vi.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It should be borne in mind that even in Great Britain an inescutcheon
  <i>en surtout</i> does not always mean an heiress-wife. The Earl of Mar
  and Kellie bears an inescutcheon surmounted by an earl's coronet for his
  Earldom of Kellie, and other instances are to be found in the arms of
  Cumming-Gordon (see Plate III.), whilst Sir Hector Maclean Hay, Bart.,
  thus bears his pronominal arms over his quarterings in continental
  fashion. Inescutcheons of augmentation occur in the arms of the Dukes of
  Marlborough and Wellington, Lord Newton, and on the shields of Newman,
  Wolfe, and others.</p>

  <p>Under the Commonwealth the Great Seals of Oliver Cromwell and his son
  Richard, as Protectors, bore a shield of arms: "Quarterly, 1 and 4,
  argent, a cross gules (for England); 2. azure, a saltire argent (for
  Scotland); 3. azure, a harp or, stringed argent (for Ireland);" and upon
  these quarterings <i>en surtout</i> an escutcheon of the personal arms of
  Cromwell: "Sable, a lion rampant argent."</p>

  <p>In the heraldry of the Continent of Europe it has long been the custom
  for an elected sovereign to place his hereditary arms in an escutcheon
  <i>en surtout</i> above those of his dominions. As having obtained the
  crown by popular election, the Kings of the Hellenes also place <i>en
  surtout</i> upon the arms of the Greek kingdom ("Azure, a Greek cross
  couped argent") an escutcheon of their personal arms. Another instance is
  to be found in the arms of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Whilst all
  the descendants of the late Prince Consort (other than his Majesty King
  Edward VII.) bear in England the Royal Arms of this country, differenced
  by their respective labels with an escutcheon of Saxony <i>en surtout</i>
  as Dukes and Duchesses of Saxony, the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha
  bore <!-- Page 542 --><span class="pagenum" title="602.png"><a
  name="page542"></a>{542}</span>the arms of Saxony, placing the
  differenced Royal shield of this country <i>en surtout</i>.</p>

  <p>We now come to the subject of quartering. Considering the fact that
  every single text-book on armory gives the ordinary rules for the
  marshalling of quarterings, it is strange how many mistakes are made, and
  how extremely funny are the ideas of some people upon the subject of
  quartering. As has already been stated, the rules of quartering are
  governed by the simple, but essential and important fact, that every
  quartering exhibited means the representation in blood of some particular
  person. Quarterings, other than those of augmentation, can only be
  inherited from or through those female ancestors who are in themselves
  heirs or coheirs in blood, or whose issue subsequently become in a later
  generation the representatives of any ancestor in the male line of that
  said female ancestor. Briefly speaking, a woman is an heiress, first, if
  she is only child; second, if all her brothers die without issue in her
  own lifetime; and third, if the entire issue, male and female, of her
  brothers, becomes extinct in her own lifetime. A woman becomes an
  "heiress in her issue," as it is termed, if she die before her brothers,
  if and when all the descendants of her brothers become absolutely
  extinct.</p>

  <p>If the wife be either an heir or coheir, she transmits after her death
  to <i>all</i> her children the arms and quarterings&mdash;<i>as
  quarterings to add to their paternal arms, and as such
  only</i>&mdash;which she was entitled to place upon her own lozenge.</p>

  <p>The origin and theory of quartering is as follows: If the daughter be
  an heiress or coheiress she represents either wholly or in part her
  father and his branch of the family, even if "his branch" only commenced
  with himself. Now in the days when the science of armory was slowly
  evolving itself there was no Married Women's Property Act, and the
  husband <i>ipso facto</i> became to all intents and purposes possessed of
  and enjoyed the rights of his wife. But it was at the same time only a
  possession and enjoyment by courtesy, and not an actual possession in
  fee, for the reversion remained with the wife's heirs, and did not pass
  to the heirs of the husband; for in cases where the husband or wife had
  been previously married, or where there was no issue of their marriage,
  their heirs would not be identical. Of course during the lifetime of his
  wife he could not actually <i>represent</i> his wife's family, and
  consequently could not quarter the arms, but in right of his wife he
  "pretended" to the representation of her house, and consequently the
  inescutcheon of her arms is termed an "escutcheon of pretence."</p>

  <p>After the death of a wife her children immediately and actually become
  the representatives of their mother, and are as such <i>entitled</i> of
  right to quarter the arms of their mother's family. <!-- Page 543
  --><span class="pagenum" title="603.png"><a
  name="page543"></a>{543}</span></p>

  <p>The earliest example which has been discovered at the present time of
  the use of a quartered coat of arms is afforded by the seal of Joanna of
  Ponthieu, second wife of Ferdinand III., King of Castile and Leon, in
  1272. This seal bears on its reverse in a vesica the triple-towered
  castles of Castile, and the rampant lion of Leon, repeated as in the
  modern quarterings of Spain. There is, however, no separation of the
  quarters by a line of partition. This peculiarity will be also noticed as
  existing in the quartered coats of Hainault a quarter of a century later.
  The quartered coat of Castile and Leon remains upon the monument in
  Westminster Abbey erected in memory of Eleanor of Castile, who died in
  1290, the first wife of Edward I.</p>

  <p>Providing the wife be an heiress&mdash;and for the remainder of this
  chapter, which deals only with quarterings, this will be
  assumed&mdash;the son of a marriage <i>after the death</i> of his mother
  quarters her arms with those of his father, that is, he divides his
  shield into four quarters, and places the arms of his father in the first
  and fourth quarters, and the arms of his mother in the second and third.
  That is the root, basis, and original rule of all the rules of
  quartering, but it may be here remarked, that no man is entitled to
  quarter the arms of his mother whilst she is alive, inasmuch as she is
  alive to represent herself and her family, and her issue cannot assume
  the representation whilst she is alive.</p>

  <p>But it should not be imagined that the definite rules which exist at
  the moment had any such unalterable character in early times. Husbands
  are found to have quartered the arms of their wives if they were
  heiresses, and if important lordships devolved through the marriage.
  Territorial arms of dominion were quartered with personal arms (Fig.
  755), quarterings of augmentation were granted, and the present system is
  the endeavour to reconcile all the varying circumstances and precedents
  which exist. One point, however, stands out clearly from all ancient
  examples, viz. that quartering meant quartering, and a shield was
  supposed to have but four quarters upon it. Consequently we find that

  name="page544"></a>{544}</span>10, 20, 50, or 100 quarterings, the shield
  had but four; and this being admitted and recognised, it became essential
  that the four most important should be shown, and consequently we find
  that quarterings were selected in a manner which would seem to us
  haphazard. Paternal quarterings were dropped and the result has been that
  many coats of arms are now known as the arms of a family with quite a
  different surname from that of the family with which they originated. The
  matter was of little consequence in the days when the "upper-class" and
  arms-bearing families were few in number. Every one knew how Stafford
  derived his Royal descent, and that it was not male upon male, so no
  confusion resulted from the Earls of Buckingham giving the Royal coat
  precedence before their paternal quartering of Stafford (see Fig. 756),
  or from their using only the Woodstock version of the Royal Arms; but as
  time went on the upper classes became more numerous, arms-bearing
  ancestors by the succession of generations increased in number, and while
  in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it would be a physical
  impossibility for any man to have represented one hundred different
  heiresses of arms-bearing families, in later days such became the case.
  The result has been the necessity to formulate those strict and rigid
  rules which for modern purposes must be conformed to, and it is futile
  and childish to deduce a set of rules from ancient and possibly isolated
  examples originating in and suitable for the simpler genealogical
  circumstances of an earlier day, and assert that it is equally
  permissible to adopt them at the moment, or to marshal a modern shield
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>The first attempt to break away from the four quarters of a shield was
  the initiation of the system of grand quarters (see Figs. 755 and 756).
  By this means the relative importance could roughly be shown. Supposing a
  man had inherited a shield of four quarters and then married a wife in
  whom was vested a peerage, he naturally wished to display the arms
  connected with that peerage, for these were of greater importance than
  his own four quarterings. The problem was how to introduce the fifth. In
  some cases we find it borne in pretence, but in other cases, particularly
  in a later generation, we find that important quarter given the whole of
  a quarter of the shield to itself, the other four being conjoined
  together and displayed so as to occupy a similar space. These, therefore,
  became sub-quarters. The system also had advantages, because it permitted
  coats which by constant quartering had become <!-- Page 545 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="605.png"><a
  name="page545"></a>{545}</span>indivisible to be perpetuated in this
  form. So definite was this rule, that in only one of the series of Garter
  plates anterior to the Tudor period is any shield found containing more
  than four quarters, though many of these are grand quarters containing
  other coats borne sub-quarterly. The one instance which I refer to as an
  exception is the shield of the Duke D'Urbino, and it is quite possible
  that this should not be quoted as an instance in point. He appears to
  have borne in the ordinary way four quarters, but he subsequently added
  thereto two quarterings which may or may not have been one and the same
  coat of arms by way of augmentation. These he placed in pale in the
  centre of the others, thus making the shield apparently one of six
  quarters.</p>

  <p>But one is safe in the assertion that during the Plantagenet period no
  more than four quarters were ordinarily placed upon a shield. Then we
  come to the brief period of "squeezed in" quarterings (Figs. 757 and
  758). In the early Visitations we get instances of six, eight, and even a
  larger number, and the start once being made, and the number of four
  relinquished, there was of course no reason why it should not be extended
  indefinitely. This appears to have rapidly become the case, and we find
  that schemes of quarterings are now proved and recorded officially in
  England and Ireland some of which exceed 200 in number. The record number
  of officially proved and recorded quarterings is at present held by the
  family of Lloyd, of Stockton in Chirbury, co. Salop, but many of the
  quarterings of this family are mere repetition owing to constant
  intermarriages, and to the fact that a single Welsh line of male descent
  often results in a number of different shields. Welsh arms did not
  originally have the hereditary unchangeability we are accustomed to in
  English heraldry, and moreover a large proportion are later inventions
  borne to denote descent and are not arms actually used by those they
  stand for, so that the recorded scheme <!-- Page 546 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="606.png"><a name="page546"></a>{546}</span>of the
  quarterings of Mr. Money-Kyrle, or of the sister Countesses of Yarborough
  and Powis, respectively Baroness Fauconberg and Conyers and Baroness
  Darcy de Knayth are decidedly more enviable. Nobody of course attempts to
  bear such a number. In Scotland, however, even to the present day, the
  system of four quarterings is still adhered to. The result is that in
  Scotland the system of grand quarterings is still pursued, whilst in
  England it is almost unknown, except in cases where coats of arms have
  for some reason or another become indivisible. This is a very patent
  difficulty when it becomes necessary to marshal indivisible Scottish
  coats with English ones, and the system of cadency adopted in Scotland,
  which has its chief characteristic in the employment of bordures, makes
  the matter sometimes very far from simple. The system adopted at the
  present time in the case of a Royal Licence, for example, to bear a
  Scottish name and arms where the latter is a coat of many quarterings
  within a bordure, is to treat such coat as made indivisible by and
  according to the most recent matriculation. That coat is then treated as
  a grand quartering of an equivalent value to the pronominal coat in
  England.</p>

  <p>But reverting to the earlier chart, by the aid of which heirship was
  demonstrated, the following were entitled to transmit the Cilfowyr arms
  as quarterings. Mary, Ellen, Blanche, Grace, Muriel, and Dorothy all had
  the right to transmit. By the death of Dorothy <i>v.p.</i> Alice and
  Annie both became entitled. Maria Jane and Hannah would have been
  entitled to transmit Sherwin and Cilfowyr, but not Cilfowyr alone, if
  there had been no arms for Sherwin, though they could have transmitted
  Sherwin alone if there had been arms for Sherwin and none for Cilfowyr.
  Harriet would have transmitted the arms of Cilfowyr if she had survived,
  and Ada would, each subject to differences as has been previously
  explained.</p>

  <p>As has been already explained, every woman is entitled to bear upon a
  lozenge in her own lifetime the arms, quarterings, and difference marks
  which belonged to her father. If her mother were an heiress she adds her
  mother's arms to her father's, and her mother's quarterings also,
  marshalling the whole into a correct sequence, and placing the said
  sequence of quarterings upon a lozenge. Such are the armorial bearings of
  a daughter. If the said daughter be not an heraldic heiress in blood she
  <i>cannot</i> transmit either arms or quarterings to her descendants.
  Needless to say, no woman, heiress or non-heiress, can now transmit a
  crest, and no woman can bear either crest, helmet, mantling, or motto. A
  daughter not being an heiress simply confers the right upon her husband
  to <i>impale</i> upon his shield such arms and difference marks as her
  father bore in his own right. If an heiress possessing arms marry a man
  with illegal arms, or a man making no pretensions to arms, her children
  have no arms at all, and really inherit <!-- Page 547 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="607.png"><a
  name="page547"></a>{547}</span>nothing; and the rights, such as they are,
  to the arms of the mother as a quartering remain, and must remain,
  <i>dormant</i> unless and until arms are established for their father's
  line, inasmuch as they can only inherit armorially from their mother
  <i>through</i> their father. In England it is always optional for a man
  to have arms assigned to him to fill in any blanks which would otherwise
  mar his scheme of quarterings.</p>

  <p>Let us now see how various coats of arms are marshalled as quarterings
  into one achievement.</p>

  <p>The original theory of quartering upon which all rules are based is
  that after a marriage with an heiress, necessitating for the children the
  combination of the two coats, the shield is divided into four quarters.
  These four are numbered from the top left-hand (the dexter) corner (No.
  1) across towards the sinister (No. 2) side of the shield; then the next
  row is numbered in the same way (Nos. 3 and 4). This rule as to the
  method of numbering holds good for any number of quarterings.</p>

  <p>In allocating the position of the different coats to their places in
  the scheme of quarterings, the pronominal coat must <i>always</i> be in
  the first quartering.</p>

  <p>In a simple case (the exceptions will presently be referred to) that
  places the arms of the father in the first and fourth quarters, and the
  arms of the mother in the second and third; such, of course, being on the
  assumption that the father possessed only a simple coat without
  quarterings, and that the mother was in the same position. The children
  therefore possess a coat of four quarters (Fig. 759). Suppose a son of
  theirs in his turn marries another heiress, also possessing only a simple
  coat without quarterings, he bears arms as Fig. 760, and the
  grandchildren descending from the aforesaid marriage put that
  last-mentioned coat in the third quarter, and the coat, though still of
  only four quarters, is: 1 and 4, the pronominal coat; 2, the first
  heiress; 3, the second (Fig. 761).</p>

  <p>If another single quartering is brought in, in a later generation,
  that takes the place of No. 4. So far it is all plain sailing, but very
  <!-- Page 548 --><span class="pagenum" title="608.png"><a
  name="page548"></a>{548}</span>few text-books carry one beyond this
  point. Another single quartering inherited gives five quarterings to be
  displayed on one shield. The usual plan is to repeat the first
  quartering, and gives you six, which are then arranged in two rows of
  three. If the shield be an impaled shield one sometimes sees them
  arranged in three rows of two, but this is unusual though not incorrect.
  But five quarterings are sometimes arranged in two rows, three in the
  upper and two in the lower, and with a shield of the long pointed variety
  this plan may be adopted with advantage. Subsequent quarterings, as they
  are introduced by subsequent marriages, take their places, Nos. 6, 7, 8,
  9, 10, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

  <p>In arranging them on one shield, the order in which they devolve
  (according to the <i>pedigree</i> and <i>not</i> necessarily according to
  the <i>date</i> order in which they are inherited) must be rigidly
  adhered to; but a person is perfectly at liberty (1) to repeat the
  <i>first</i> quartering at the end to make an even number or not at his
  pleasure, but no more than the first quartering must be repeated in such
  cases; (2) to arrange the quarters in any number of rows he may find most
  convenient according to the shape of the space the quarterings will
  occupy.</p>

  <p>Upon the Continent it is usual to specify the number and position of
  the lines by which the shield is divided. Thus, while an English herald
  would say simply, <i>Quarterly of six</i>, and leave it to the painter's
  or engraver's taste to arrange the quarterings in three rows of two, or
  in two rows of three, a French or German herald would ordinarily specify
  the arrangement to be used in distinct terms.</p>

  <p>If a man possessing only a simple coat of arms without quarterings
  marry an heiress with a number of quarterings (<i>e.g.</i> say twenty),
  he himself places the arms and quarterings of his wife in pretence. Their
  children eventually, as a consequence, inherit twenty-one quarterings.
  The first is the coat of their father, the second is the first coat of
  the mother, and the remaining nineteen follow in a regular sequence,
  according to their position upon their mother's achievement.</p>

  <p>To sum the rule up, it is necessary first to take <i>all</i> the
  quarterings inherited from the father and arrange them in a proper
  sequence, and then follow on <i>in the same sequence</i> with the arms
  and quarterings inherited from the mother.</p>

  <p>The foregoing explanations should show how generation by generation
  quarterings are added to a paternal shield, but I have found that many of
  those who possess a knowledge of the laws to this extent are yet at a
  loss, given a pedigree, to marshal the resulting quarterings in their
  right order.</p>

  <p>Given your pedigree&mdash;the first quartering <i>must</i> be <i>the
  pronominal coat</i> (I am here presuming no change of name or arms has
  occurred), which is the coat of the strict male line of descent. Then
  follow this male line back as far as it is known. The second quartering
  is the <!-- Page 549 --><span class="pagenum" title="609.png"><a
  name="page549"></a>{549}</span>coat of the <i>first</i> heiress who
  married your earliest ancestor in the male line who is known to have
  married an heiress. Then after her coat will follow all the quarterings
  which she was entitled to and which she has "brought in" to your family.
  Having exhausted these, you then follow your male line <i>down</i> to the
  next heiress, adding her arms as a quartering to those already arranged,
  and following it by her quarterings. The same plan must be pursued until
  you arrive at your own name upon the pedigree. Unless some exceptional
  circumstance has arisen (and such exceptions will presently be found
  detailed at length), all the quarterings are of equal heraldic value, and
  must be the same size when displayed.</p>

  <p>If after having worked out your quarterings you find that you have
  more than you care to use, you are quite at liberty to make a selection,
  omitting any number, <i>but</i> it is entirely <i>wrong</i> to display
  quarterings without those quarterings which brought them into the
  paternal line. Supposing your name to be Brown, you <i>must</i> put the
  Brown arms in the first quarter, but at your pleasure you can quarter the
  arms of each single heiress who married an ancestor of yours in the male
  line (<i>i.e.</i> who herself became Mrs. Brown), or you can omit the
  whole or a part. But supposing one of these, Mrs. Brown (<i>née</i>
  Smith), was entitled to quarter the arms of Jones, which arms of Jones
  had brought in the arms of Robinson, you are not at liberty to quarter
  the arms of Jones without quartering Smith, and if you wish to display
  the arms of Robinson you <i>must</i> also quarter the arms of Jones to
  bring in Robinson and the arms of Smith to bring in Robinson and Jones to
  your own Brown achievement. You can use Brown only: or quarterly, 1 and
  4, Brown; 2 and 3, Smith: or 1 and 4, Brown; 2. Smith; 3. Jones: or
  quarterly, 1. Brown; 2. Smith; 3. Jones; 4. Robinson; but you are
  <i>not</i> entitled to quarter: 1 and 4, Brown; 2. Jones; 3. Robinson,
  because Smith, which brought in Jones and Robinson, has been omitted, and
  there was never a match between Brown and Jones.</p>

  <p>Quarterings signifying nothing beyond mere representation are not
  compulsory, and their use or disuse is quite optional.</p>

  <p>So much for the general rules of quartering. Let us now consider
  certain cases which require rules to themselves.</p>

  <p>It is possible for a daughter to be the sole heir or coheir of her
  mother whilst not being the heir of her father, as in the following
  imaginary pedigree:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In this case Joan is not the heir of her father, inasmuch as he has
  sons Thomas and Henry, but she is the heir of her mother and the only
  issue capable of inheriting and transmitting the Conyers arms and
  quarterings. Joan is heir of her mother but not of her father.</p>

  <p>The husband of Joan can either impale the arms of Darcy as having
  married a daughter of John Darcy, or he can place upon an escutcheon of
  pretence arms to indicate that he has married the heiress of Conyers. But
  it would be quite incorrect for him to simply place Conyers in pretence,
  because he has not married a Miss Conyers. What he must do is to charge
  the arms of Conyers with a dexter canton of the arms of Darcy and place
  this upon his escutcheon of pretence.<a name="NtA_30"

  Conyers with the canton of Darcy and inherit likewise all the quarterings

  accrues to the Darcy quarterings.</p>

</table>

  <p>It is officially admitted (see the introduction to Burke's "General
  Armory") that the claim is accurately made. The process of reasoning is
  probably thus. John Williams places upon an escutcheon of pretence the
  arms of Smith, and Alice Williams succeeds in her own right to the arms
  of her mother because the latter was an heiress, and for herself is
  entitled to bear, as would a son, the arms of the two parents quarterly;
  and having so inherited, Alice Williams being herself an heiress, is
  entitled to transmit. At any rate Arthur Ellis is entitled to impale or
  place upon his escutcheon of pretence Williams and Smith quarterly. To
  admit the right for the descendants to quarter the arms Arthur Ellis so
  bore is no more than a logical progression, but the eventual result
  appears faulty, because we find Theodore Ellis quartering the arms of
  Smith, whilst the representation of Smith is in the line of Edward
  Roberts. This curious set of circumstances, however, is rare in the
  extreme.</p>

  <p>It frequently happens, in devising a scheme of quarterings, that a
  person may represent heiresses of several families entitled to bear arms,
  but to whom the pedigree must be traced through an heiress of another
  family which did not possess arms. Consequently any claim to quarterings
  inherited through the non-armorial heiress is dormant, and the
  quarterings must not be used or inserted in any scheme drawn up. It is
  always permissible, however, to petition for arms to be granted to be
  borne for that non-armorial family for the purpose of introducing the
  quarterings in question, and such a grant having been made, the dormant
  claim then becomes operative and the new coat is introduced, followed by
  the dormant quartering in precisely the same manner as would have been
  the case if the arms granted had always existed. Grants of this character
  are constantly being obtained. <!-- Page 552 --><span class="pagenum" title="612.png"
  ><a name="page552"></a>{552}</span></p>

  <p>When a Royal Licence to assume or change name and arms is granted it
  very considerably affects the question of quartering, and many varying
  circumstances attending these Royal Licences make the matter somewhat
  intricate. If the Royal Licence is to assume a name and arms in lieu of
  those previously used, this means that for everyday use the arms are
  <i>changed</i>, the right to the old arms lapsing except for the purpose
  of a scheme of quarterings. The new coat of arms under the terms of the
  Royal Licence, which requires it first "to be exemplified in our Royal
  College of Arms, otherwise this our Royal Licence to be void and of none
  effect," is always so exemplified, this exemplification being from the
  legal point of view equivalent to a new grant of the arms to the person
  assuming them. The terms of the Royal Licence have always carefully to be
  borne in mind, particularly in the matter of remainder, because sometimes
  these exemplifications are for a limited period or intended to devolve
  with specified property, and a Royal Licence only nullifies a prior right
  to arms to the extent of the terms recited in the Letters Patent of
  exemplification. In the ordinary way, however, such an exemplification is
  equivalent to a new grant affecting all the descendants. When it is
  assumed in lieu, for the ordinary purpose of use the new coat of arms
  takes the place of the old one, but the right to the old one remains in
  theory to a certain extent, inasmuch as its existence <i>is necessary</i>
  in any scheme of quartering <i>to bring in</i> any quarterings previously
  inherited, and these cannot be displayed with the new coat unless they
  are preceded by the old one. Quarterings, however, which are brought into
  the family through a marriage in the generation in which the Royal
  Licence is obtained, or in a subsequent generation, can be displayed with
  the new coat without the interposition of the old one.</p>

  <p>If the Royal Licence be to bear the name of a certain family in lieu
  of a present name, and to bear the arms of that family quarterly with the
  arms previously borne, the quarterly coat is then exemplified. In an
  English or Irish Royal Licence the coat of arms for the name assumed is
  placed in the first and the fourth quarters, and the old paternal arms
  figure in the second and third. This is an invariable rule. The quarterly
  coat thus exemplified becomes an indivisible coat for the new name, and
  it is not permissible to subsequently divide these quarterings. They
  become as much one coat of arms as "azure, a bend or" is the coat of arms
  of Scrope. If this quarterly coat is to be introduced in any scheme of
  quarterings it will only occupy the same space as any other single
  quartering and counts only as one, though it of course is in reality a
  grand quartering. In devising a scheme of quarterings for which a
  sub-quarterly coat of this character exemplified under a Royal Licence is
  the pronominal coat, that <!-- Page 553 --><span class="pagenum" title="613.png"
  ><a name="page553"></a>{553}</span>quarterly coat is placed in the first
  quarter. Next to it is placed the original coat of arms borne as the
  pronominal coat before the Royal Licence and exemplified in the second
  and third sub-quarters of the first quarter. When here repeated it
  occupies an entire quarter. Next to it are placed the whole of the
  quarterings belonging to the family in the order in which they occur. If
  the family whose name has been assumed is represented through an heiress
  that coat of arms is also repeated in its proper position and in that
  place in which it would have appeared if unaffected by the Royal Licence.
  But if it be the coat of arms of a family from whom there is no descent,
  or of whom there is no representation, the fact of the Royal Licence does
  not give any further right to quarter it beyond its appearance in the
  pronominal grand quartering. The exact state of the case is perhaps best
  illustrated by the arms of Reid-Cuddon. The name of the family was
  originally Reid, and representing an heiress of the Cuddons of
  Shaddingfield Hall they obtained a Royal Licence to take the name and
  arms of Cuddon in addition to the name and arms of Reid, becoming
  thereafter Reid-Cuddon. The arms were exemplified in due course, and the
  achievement then became: Quarterly, 1 and 4, Reid-Cuddon sub-quarterly,
  2. the arms of Reid, 3. the arms of Cuddon. In Scotland no such thing as
  a Royal Licence exists, the matter being determined merely by a
  rematriculation following upon a voluntary change of name. There is no
  specified order or position for the arms of the different names, and the
  arrangement of the various quarterings is left to be determined by the
  circumstances of the case. Thus in the arms of Anstruther-Duncan the arms
  of Anstruther are in the first quarter, and the matter is always largely
  governed by the importance of the respective estates and the respective
  families. In England this is not the case, because it is an unalterable
  rule that the arms of the last or principal surname if there be two, or
  the arms of the one surname if that be the case when the arms of two
  families are quartered, must always go in the 1st and 4th quarters. If
  three names are assumed by Royal Licence, the arms of the last name go in
  the 1st and 4th quarters, and the last name but one in the second
  quarter, and of the first name in the third. These cases are, however,
  rare. But no matter how many names are assumed, and no matter how many
  original coats of arms the shield as exemplified consists of, it
  thereafter becomes an indivisible coat.</p>

  <p>When a Royal Licence is issued to an illegitimate person to bear the
  name and arms of another family, no right is conferred to bear the
  quarterings of that family even subject to difference marks. The Royal
  Licence is only applicable to whatever arms were the pronominal coat used
  with the name assumed. Though instances <!-- Page 554 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="614.png"><a
  name="page554"></a>{554}</span>certainly can be found in some of the
  Visitation Books and other ancient records of a coat with quarterings,
  the whole debruised by a bendlet sinister, notably in the case of a
  family of Talbot, where eight quarters are so marked, the fact remains
  that this practice has long been definitely considered incorrect, and is
  now never permitted. If a Royal Licence is issued to an illegitimate
  woman the exemplification is to herself personally, for in the eyes of
  the law she has no relatives; and though she may be one of a large
  family, her descendants are entitled to quarter the arms with the marks
  of distinction exemplified to her because such quartering merely
  indicates the representation of that one woman, who in the eyes of the
  law stands alone and without relatives. In the case of a Royal Licence to
  take a name and arms subject to these marks of distinction for
  illegitimacy, and in cases where the arms to be assumed are a
  sub-quarterly coat, the mark of distinction, which in England is now
  invariably a bordure wavy, will surround both quarterings, which remain
  an indivisible coat.</p>

  <p>If an augmentation is granted to a person whose pronominal coat is
  sub-quarterly, that augmentation, whatever form it may assume, is
  superimposed upon all quarterings. Thus a chief of augmentation would go
  across the top of the shield, the four quarters being displayed below,
  and the whole of this shield would be only one quartering in any scheme
  of quartering. An inescutcheon is superimposed over all. If the
  augmentation take the form of a quartering, then the pronominal coat is a
  grand quartering, equivalent in size to the augmentation. If a person
  entitled to a sub-quarterly coat and a double name obtains a Royal
  Licence to bear another name and arms, and to bear the arms he has
  previously borne quarterly with those he has assumed, the result would
  be: Quarterly, 1 and 4, the new coat assumed, quarterly 2 and 3, the arms
  he has previously borne sub-quarterly. But it should be noticed that the
  arrangements of coats of arms under a Royal Licence largely depends upon
  the wording of the document by which authority is given by the Sovereign.
  The wording of the document in its terms is based upon the wording of the
  petition, and within reasonable limits any arrangement which is desired
  is usually permitted, so that care should be taken as to the wording of
  the petition.</p>

  <p>A quartering of augmentation is always placed in the first quarter of
  a shield, but it becomes indivisible from and is depicted sub-quarterly
  with the paternal arms; for instance, the Dukes of Westminster for the
  time being, but not other members of the family, bear as an augmentation
  the arms of the city of Westminster in the 1st and 4th quarters of his
  shield, and the arms of Grosvenor in the 2nd and 3rd, but this coat of
  Westminster and Grosvenor is an indivisible <!-- Page 555 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="615.png"><a
  name="page555"></a>{555}</span>quarterly coat which together would only
  occupy the first quarter in a shield of quarterings. Then the second one
  would be the arms of Grosvenor alone, which would be followed by the
  quarterings previously inherited.</p>

  <p>If under a Royal Licence a name is assumed and the Royal Licence makes
  no reference to the arms of the family, the arms for all purposes remain
  unchanged and as if no Royal Licence had ever been issued. If the Royal
  Licence issued to a family simply exemplifies a single coat of arms, it
  is quite wrong to introduce any other coat of arms to convert this single
  coat into a sub-quarterly one.</p>

  <p>To all intents and purposes it may be stated that in Scotland there
  are still only four quarters in a shield, and if more than four coats are
  introduced grand quarterings are employed. Grand quarterings are very
  frequent in Scottish armory. The Scottish rules of quartering follow no
  fixed principle, and the constant rematriculations make it impossible to
  deduce exact rules; and though roughly approximating to the English ones,
  no greater generalisation can be laid down than the assertion that the
  most recent matriculation of an ancestor governs the arms and quarterings
  to be displayed.</p>

  <p>A royal quartering is never subdivided.</p>

  <p>In combining Scottish and English coats of arms into one scheme of
  quartering, it is usual if possible to treat the coat of arms as
  matriculated in Scotland as a grand quartering equivalent in value to any
  other of the English quarterings. This, however, is not always possible
  in cases where the matriculation itself creates grand quarterings and
  sub-quarterings; and for a scheme of quarterings in such a case it is
  more usual for the Scottish matriculation to be divided up into its
  component parts, and for these to be used as simple quarterings in
  succession to the English ones, regardless of any bordure which may exist
  in the Scottish matriculation. It cannot, of course, be said that such a
  practice is beyond criticism, though it frequently remains the only
  practical way of solving the difficulty.</p>

  <p>Until comparatively recent times, if amongst quarterings inherited the
  Royal Arms were included, it was considered a fixed, unalterable rule
  that these should be placed in the first quarter, taking precedence of
  the pronominal coat, irrespective of their real position according to the
  date or pedigree place of introduction. This rule, however, has long
  since been superseded, and Royal quarterings now take their position on
  the same footing as the others. It very probably arose from the
  misconception of the facts concerning an important case which doubtless
  was considered a precedent. The family of Mowbray, after their marriage
  with the heiress of Thomas de Brotherton, used either the arms of
  Brotherton alone, these being England differenced <!-- Page 556 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="616.png"><a name="page556"></a>{556}</span>by a
  label, or else placed them in the first quarter of their shield.
  Consequently from this precedent a rule was deduced that it was
  permissible and correct to give a Royal quartering precedence over all
  others. The position of the Mowbrays, Dukes of Norfolk, as Earls Marshal
  no doubt led to their own achievement being considered an exemplary
  model. But it appears to have been overlooked that the Mowbrays bore
  these Royal Arms of Brotherton not as an inherited quartering but as a
  grant to themselves. Richard II. apparently granted them permission to
  bear the arms of Edward the Confessor impaled with the arms of
  Brotherton, the whole between the two Royal ostrich feathers (Fig. 675),
  and consequently, the grant having been made, the Mowbrays were under no
  necessity to display the Mowbray or the Segrave arms to bring in the arms
  of Brotherton. A little later a similar case occurred with the Stafford
  family, who became sole heirs-general of Thomas of Woodstock, and
  consequently entitled to bear his arms as a quartering. The matter
  appears to have been settled at a chapter of the College of Arms, and the
  decision arrived at was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h5><i>Cott. MS., Titus, C. i. fol. 404, in handwriting of end of sixteenth century.</i></h5>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>[An order made for Henry Duke of Buckingham to beare the Armes of
  Thomas of Woodstock alone without any other Armes to bee quartered
  therewith. Anno 13 E 4.]</p>

  <p>Memorandum that in the yeare of the Reigne of our Soveraign Lord King
  Edward the iiij<sup>th</sup>, the Thurtein in the xviij<sup>tin</sup> day
  of ffeverir, it was concluded in a Chapitre of the office of Armes that
  where a nobleman is descended lenyalle Ineritable to iij. or iiij. Cotes
  and afterward is ascended to a Cotte neir to the King and of his royall
  bloud, may for his most onneur bere the same Cootte alone, and none lower
  Coottes of Dignite to be quartered therewith. As my Lord Henry Duke of
  Buckingham, Eirll of Harford, Northamton, and Stafford, Lord of Breknoke
  and of Holdernes, is assended to the Coottes and ayer to Thomas of
  Woodstoke, Duke of Glocestre and Sonne to King Edward the third, hee may
  beire his Cootte alone. And it was so Concluded by [Claurancieulx King of
  Armes, Marche King of Armes, Gyen King of Armes, Windesor Herauld, Fawcon
  Herauld, Harfford Herald].</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But I imagine that this decision was in all probability founded upon
  the case of the Mowbrays, which was not in itself an exact precedent,
  because with the Staffords there appears to have been no such Royal grant
  as existed with the Mowbrays. Other instances at about this period can be
  alluded to, but though it must be admitted that the rule existed at one
  time, it has long since been officially overridden.</p>

  <p>A territorial coat or a coat of arms borne to indicate the possession
  of a specific title is either placed in the first quarter or borne in
  <!-- Page 557 --><span class="pagenum" title="617.png"><a
  name="page557"></a>{557}</span>pretence; see the arms of the Earl of Mar
  and Kellie. A singular instance of a very exceptional method of
  marshalling occurs in the case of the arms of the Earl of Caithness. He
  bears four coats of arms, some being stated to be territorial coats,
  quarterly, dividing them by the cross engrailed sable from his paternal
  arms of Sinclair. The arms of the Earls of Caithness are thus marshalled:
  "Quarterly, 1. azure, within a Royal tressure a ship with furled sails
  all or." For Orkney: "2 and 3. or, a lion rampant gules." For Spar (a
  family in possession of the Earldom of Caithness before the Sinclairs):
  "4. Azure, a ship in sail or, for Caithness"; and over all, dividing the
  quarters, a cross engrailed "sable," for Sinclair. The Barons Sinclair of
  Sweden (so created 1766, but extinct ten years later) bore the above
  quartered coats as cadets of Caithness, but separated the quarters, not
  by the engrailed cross sable of Sinclair, but by a cross patée throughout
  ermine. In an escutcheon <i>en surtout</i> they placed the Sinclair arms:
  "Argent, a cross engrailed sable"; and, as a mark of cadency, they
  surrounded the main escutcheon with "a bordure chequy or and gules." This
  arrangement was doubtless suggested by the Royal Arms of Denmark, the
  quarterings of which have been for so many centuries separated by the
  cross of the Order of the Dannebrog: "Argent, a cross patée throughout
  fimbriated gules." In imitation of this a considerable number of the
  principal Scandinavian families use a cross patée throughout to separate
  the quarters of their frequently complicated coats. The quarterings in
  these cases are often not indicative of descent from different families,
  but were all included in the original grant of armorial bearings. On the
  centre of the cross thus used, an escutcheon, either of augmentation or
  of the family arms, is very frequently placed <i>en surtout</i>.</p>

  <p>The main difference between British and foreign usage with regard to
  quartering is this, that in England quarterings are usually employed to
  denote simply descent from an heiress, or representation in blood; in
  Scotland they also implied the possession of lordships. In foreign coats
  the quarterings are often employed to denote the possession of fiefs
  acquired in other ways than by marriage (<i>e.g.</i> by bequest or
  purchase), or the <i>jus expectationis</i>, the right of succession to
  such fiefs in accordance with certain agreements.</p>

  <p>In foreign heraldry the base of the quartered shield is not
  unfrequently cut off by a horizontal line, forming what is known as a
  <i>Champagne</i>, and the space thus made is occupied by one or more
  coats. At other times a pile with curved sides runs from the base some
  distance into the quartered shield, which is then said to be <i>enté en
  point</i>, and this space is devoted to the display of one or more
  quarterings. The definite and precise British regulations which have
  grown up on the <!-- Page 558 --><span class="pagenum" title="618.png"><a
  name="page558"></a>{558}</span>subject of the marshalling of arms have no
  equivalent in the armorial laws of other countries.</p>

  <p>Very rarely quartering is affected <i>per saltire</i>, as in the arms
  of Sicily and in a few coats of Spanish origin, but even as regards
  foreign armory the practice is so rare that it may be disregarded.</p>

  <p>The laws of marshalling upon the Continent, and particularly in
  Germany, are very far from being identical with British heraldic
  practices.</p>

  <p>The British method of impaling two coats of arms upon one shield to
  signify marriage is abroad now wholly discarded, and two shields are
  invariably made use of. These shields are placed side by side, the dexter
  shield being used to display the man's arms and the sinister those of the
  woman's family. The shields are tilted towards each other (the position
  is not quite identical with that which we term accollé). But&mdash;and
  this is a peculiarity practically unknown in England&mdash;the German
  practice invariably reverses the charges upon the dexter shield, so that
  the charges upon the two shields "respect" each other. This perhaps can
  be most readily understood by reference to Figs. 762 and 763. The former
  shows the simple arms of Von Bibelspurg, the latter the same coat allied
  with another. But it should be noted that letters or words, if they
  appear as charges upon the shield, are not reversed. This reversing of
  the charges is by no means an uncommon practice in Germany for other
  purposes. For instance, if the arms of a State are depicted surrounded by
  the arms of provinces, or if the arms of a reigning Sovereign are grouped
  within a bordure of the shields of other people, the charges on the
  shields to the dexter are almost invariably shown in reflection regarding
  the shield in the centre. This practice, resting only on what may be
  termed "heraldic courtesy," dates back to very early times, and is met
  with even in Rolls of Arms where the shields are all turned to face the
  centre. Such a system was adopted in Siebmacher's "Book of Arms." But
  what the true position of the <!-- Page 559 --><span class="pagenum" title="619.png"
  ><a name="page559"></a>{559}</span>charges should be when represented
  upon a simple shield should be determined by the position of the helmet.
  It may be of interest to state that in St. George's Chapel at Windsor the
  early Stall plates as originally set up were all disposed so that helmets
  and charges alike faced the High Altar.</p>

  <p>The conjunction of three coats of arms in Germany is effected as shown
  in Fig. 764. Although matrimonial alliance does not in Germany entail the
  conjunction of different coats of arms on one shield, such conjunction
  does occur in German heraldry, but it is comparable (in its meaning) with
  our rules of quartering and not with our rules of impalement. No such
  exact and definite rules exist in that country as are to be met with in
  our own to determine the choice of a method of conjunction, nor to
  indicate the significance to be presumed from whatever method may be
  found in use. Personal selection and the adaptability to any particular
  method of the tinctures and the charges themselves of the coats to be
  conjoined seem to be the determining factors, and the existing
  territorial attributes of German armory have a greater weight in
  marshalling than the principle of heirship which is now practically the
  sole governing factor in British heraldry. One must therefore content
  oneself with a brief recital of some of the various modes of conjunction
  which have been or are still practised. These include impalement per pale
  or per fess (Fig. 765) and dimidiation (Fig. 766), which is more usual on
  the Continent than it ever was in these kingdoms. The subdivision of the
  field, as with ourselves, is most frequently adopted; though we are
  usually confined to quartering, German armory knows no such restrictions.
  The most usual subdivisions are as given in Fig. 767. The ordinary
  quartered shield is met with in Fig. 768, which represents the arms of
  James III., Von Eltz, Elector and Archbishop of Treves (1567-1581), in
  which his personal arms of Eltz ("Per fess gules and argent, in chief a
  demi-lion issuing or") are quartered with the impersonal arms of his
  archbishopric, "Argent, a cross gules." Another method of conjunction is
  superimposition, by which the design of the one shield takes the form of
  an ordinary imposed <!-- Page 560 --><span class="pagenum" title="620.png"
  ><a name="page560"></a>{560}</span>upon the other (Fig. 769). A curious
  method of conjoining three coats is by engrafting the third in base (Fig.
  770). The constant use of the inescutcheon has been already referred to,
  and even early English armory (Figs. 706 and 710) has examples of the
  widespread Continental practice (which obtains largely in Spanish and
  Portuguese heraldry) of surrounding one coat with a bordure of
  another.</p>

  <p>The German method of conjunction by incorporation has been frequently
  pleaded in British heraldry, in efforts to account for ancient arms, but
  with us (save for occasional use for cadency differencing at an early and
  for a limited period) such incorporation only results in and signifies an
  originally <i>new</i> coat, and not an authorised marshalling of existing
  arms of prior origin and authority. The German method can best be
  explained by two examples. Let us suppose a coat "per fess argent and
  gules," with which another coat "gules, a fleur-de-lis argent," is to be
  marshalled. The result would be "per fess argent and gules, a
  fleur-de-lis counterchanged." With smaller objects a more usual method
  would duplicate the charges, thus "per bend argent and azure," and
  "argent, a star of six points azure" would result in "per bend argent and
  azure, two stars of six points counterchanged" (Fig. 771). <!-- Page 561

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXIV</h5>

<h5>THE ARMORIAL INSIGNIA OF KNIGHTHOOD</h5>

  <p>It hardly falls within the scope of the present work to detail or
  discuss the various points concerning the history or statutes of the
  different British Orders of Knighthood, and still less so of the Foreign
  Orders. The history of the English Orders alone would make a bulky
  volume. But it is necessary to treat of the matter to some limited
  extent, inasmuch as in modern heraldry in every country in Europe
  additions are made to the armorial achievement whenever it is desired to
  signify rank in any of the Orders of Knighthood.</p>

  <p>Though a large number of the early Plantagenet Garter Stall plates
  date as far back as the year 1420, it is evident that nothing in the
  armorial bearings with which they are emblazoned bears any relation to
  the order of knighthood to which they belonged until the year 1469 or
  thereabouts, when Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, was elected a
  Knight of the Garter. His Stall plate, which is of a very exceptional
  style and character, is the first to bear the garter encircling the
  shield. It is curious to notice, by the way, that upon the privy seal of
  the Duke of Burgundy, which shows the same arms depicted upon his Garter
  plate, the shield is surrounded by the collar, from which depends the
  badge of the Order of the Golden Fleece, so that it is highly probable
  that the custom of adding marks of knighthood to a shield came to us from
  the Continent. The next Garter plate, which shows the garter around the
  shield, is that of Viscount Lovel, who was elected in 1483; and the
  shield of the Earl of Derby, who was elected in the same year, also is
  encircled by the Garter. The Garter itself encircling the shields of
  knights of that order remained the only mark of knighthood used
  armorially in this country for a considerable period, though we find that
  the example was copied in Scotland soon afterwards with regard to the
  Order of the Thistle. At the commencement of the present Lyon Register,
  which dates from the year 1672, the arms of the King of Scotland, which
  are given as such and not as the King of England and Scotland, are
  described as encircled by the collar of the Order of the Thistle. This
  probably was used as the equivalent of the garter in England, for we do
  not find the collar of the <!-- Page 562 --><span class="pagenum" title="622.png"
  ><a name="page562"></a>{562}</span>Garter, together with the garter
  itself, or the ribbon circle of the Thistle, together with the collar of
  that order, until a much later period. The use of collars of knighthood
  upon the Continent to encircle coats of arms has been from the fifteenth
  century very general and extensive; examples are to be found at an
  earlier date; but the encircling of arms with the garter carrying the
  motto of the order, or with the ribbon (which is termed the circle) and
  motto of any other order is an entirely English practice, which does not
  appear to have been copied in any other country. It, of course, arose
  from the fact that the actual garter as worn by the knight of the order
  carried the motto of the order, and that by representing the garter round
  the shield, the motto of the order was of necessity also added. The Lyon
  Register, however, in the entry of record (dated 1672), states that the
  shield is "encircled with the Order of Scotland, the same being composed
  of rue and thistles having the image of St. Andrew with his crosse on his
  brest y<sup>r</sup>unto pendent," and it is by no means improbable that
  occasional instances of the heraldic use of the collar of the garter
  might be discovered at the same period. But it is not until the later
  part of the eighteenth century that it obtained anything like a regular
  use.</p>

  <p>During the Hanoverian period it became customary to encircle the
  shield first with the garter, and that in its turn with the collar of the
  order whenever it was desired to display the achievement in its most
  complete style; and though even then, as at the present day, for less
  elaborate representations the garter only was used without the collar, it
  still remains correct to display both in a full emblazonment of the arms.
  An impetus to the practice was doubtless given by the subdivision of the
  Order of the Bath, which will be presently referred to. In speaking of
  the garter, the opportunity should be taken to protest strongly against
  the objectionable practice which has arisen of using a garter to encircle
  a crest or shield and to carry the family motto. No matter what motto is
  placed upon the garter, it is both bad form and absolutely incorrect for
  any one who is not a Knight of the Garter to use a garter in any heraldic
  display.</p>

  <p>But to tabulate the existing practice the present rules as to the
  display of the arms of knights of the different orders are as
  follow:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>A Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter</i> encircles his
  escutcheon by a representation of the garter he wears. This is a belt of
  dark blue velvet edged with gold and ornamented with a heavy gold buckle
  and ornament at the end. It carries the motto of the Order, "Honi soit
  qui mal y pense," in gold letters of plain Roman character. Anciently the
  motto was spelled "Hony soit qy mal y pense," as may be noticed from some
  of the early Garter plates, and the style <!-- Page 563 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="623.png"><a name="page563"></a>{563}</span>of the
  letter was what is now known as "Old English." The garter is worn
  buckled, with the end tucked under and looped in a specified manner,
  which is the method also adopted in heraldic representations. It is quite
  permissible to use the garter alone, but a Knight of the Order is allowed
  to add outside the garter the representation of the collar of the order.
  This is of gold, consisting of twenty-six buckled garters enamelled in
  the correct colour, each surrounding a rose, the garter alternated with
  gold knots all joined up by chain links of gold. From the collar depends
  the "George," or figure of St. George on horseback encountering the
  dragon, enamelled in colours. In heraldic representations it is usual to
  ignore the specified number of links in the collar. A Knight of the
  Garter as such is entitled to claim the privilege of a grant of
  supporters, but as nowadays the order is reserved for those of the rank
  of earl and upwards, supporters will always have a prior existence in
  connection with the peerage.</p>

  <p><i>Knights of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle</i>
  are entitled to surround their arms with a plain circle of green edged
  with gold and bearing the motto in gold letters, "Nemo me impune
  lacessit." They are also entitled to surround their arms with the collar
  of the order, which is of gold, and composed of sprigs of thistle and rue
  (Andrew) enamelled in their proper colours. From the collar the badge
  (the figure of St. Andrew) depends.</p>

  <p><i>Knights of the Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick</i> are
  entitled to surround their arms by a plain circle of sky-blue edged with
  gold, bearing the motto, "Quis Separabit. <span
  class="sm">MDCCLXXXIII</span>," as enamelled on the star of the order.
  This is encircled by the collar of the order, which is of "gold, composed
  of roses and harps alternately, tied together with knots of gold, the
  said roses enamelled alternately, white leaves within red and red leaves
  within white; and in the centre of the said collar shall be an Imperial
  crown surmounting a harp of gold, from which shall hang the badge."</p>

  <p>Knights of the Thistle and St. Patrick are entitled as such to claim a
  grant of supporters on payment of the fees, but these orders are nowadays
  confined to peers.</p>

  <p><i>The Most Honourable Order of the Bath.</i>&mdash;Knights of the
  Bath, who have existed from a remote period, do not appear as such to
  have made any additions to their arms prior to the revival of the order
  in 1725. At that time, similarly to the Orders of the Garter and the
  Thistle, the order was of one class only and composed of a limited number
  of knights. Knights of that order were then distinguished by the letters
  K.B., which, it should be noted, mean Knight of the Bath, and not Knight
  Bachelor, as so many people now imagine. There is nobody at the present
  time who is entitled to use these letters. Upon those <!-- Page 564
  --><span class="pagenum" title="624.png"><a
  name="page564"></a>{564}</span>of the Bath plates which now remain in the
  chapel of Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey, no instance will be found in
  which the collar is represented outside the circle, which is pretty good
  evidence that although isolated examples may possibly be found at an
  earlier date, it was not the usual custom up to the end of the eighteenth
  century to encircle a shield with a collar of knighthood. These Knights
  of the Bath (K.B.), as they were termed, surrounded their escutcheons
  with circlets of crimson edged with gold, and bearing thereupon the motto
  of the order, "Tria juncta in uno," in gold letters.</p>

  <p>Although at that time it does not appear that the collar of the order
  was ever employed for armorial purposes, instances are to be found in
  which the laurel wreath surrounded the circlet with the motto of the
  order.</p>

  <p>In the year 1815, owing to the large number of officers who had
  merited reward in the Peninsular Campaign, it was considered necessary to
  largely increase the extent and scope of the order. For this purpose it
  was divided into two divisions&mdash;the Military Division and the Civil
  Division&mdash;and each of these were divided into three classes, namely,
  Knights Grand Cross (G.C.B.), Knights Commanders (K.C.B.), and Companions
  (C.B.). The then existing Knights of the Bath became Knights Grand Cross.
  The existing collar served for all Knights Grand Cross, but the old badge
  and star were assigned for the civil division of the order, a new pattern
  being designed for the military division. The number of stalls in Henry
  VII.'s Chapel being limited, the erection of Stall plates and the display
  of banners ceased; those then in position were allowed to remain, and
  still remain at the present moment. Consequently there are no Stall
  plates to refer to in the matter as precedents since that period, and the
  rules need to be obtained from other sources. They are now as follows: A
  Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath surrounds his arms with the
  circlet as was theretofore the case, and in addition he surrounds the
  circlet by his collar, from which depends the badge (either military or
  civil) of the division to which he belongs. The collar is really for
  practical purposes the distinguishing mark of a Knight Grand Cross,
  because although as such he is entitled upon payment of the fees to claim
  a grant of supporters, he is under no compulsion to do so, and
  comparatively but few avail themselves of the privilege. All Knights of
  the Bath, before the enlargement of the order, had supporters. A Knight
  Grand Cross of the <i>military</i> division encircles his arms with the
  laurel wreath in addition, this being placed outside the circlet and
  within the collar of the order. The collar is composed of gold having
  nine Imperial crowns and eight devices of the rose, the thistle, and
  shamrock issuing from a sceptre placed alternately and enamelled in <!--
  Page 565 --><span class="pagenum" title="625.png"><a
  name="page565"></a>{565}</span>their proper colours, the links being
  connected with seventeen knots enamelled white. The badges of the
  military and civil divisions differ considerably.</p>

  <p>Knights Commanders of the Bath have no collar and cannot claim a grant
  of supporters, but they encircle their shields with the circlet of the
  order, suspending their badge below the shield by the ribbon from which
  it is worn. Knights Commanders of the military division use the laurel
  wreath as do Knights Grand Cross, but no members of any class of the
  civil division are entitled to display it.</p>

  <p>Companions of the order (C.B.) do not use the helmet of a knight as
  does a G.C.B. or a K.C.B.; in fact, the only difference which is
  permissible in their arms from those of an undistinguished commoner is
  that they are allowed to suspend the badge of a C.B. from a ribbon below
  their shields. They do not use the circlet of the order. Certain cases
  have come under my notice in which a military C.B. has added a laurel
  wreath to his armorial bearings, but whether such a practice is correct I
  am unaware, but I think it is not officially recognised.</p>

  <p><i>The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India</i> (like the Order of
  the Bath as at present constituted) is divided into three classes,
  Knights Grand Commanders, Knights Commanders, and Companions. Knights
  Grand Commanders place the circlet of the order around their shields.
  This is of light blue inscribed with the motto, "Heaven's light our
  guide." This in its turn is surrounded by the collar of the order, which
  is composed of alternate links of the Indian lotus flower, crossed
  palm-branches, and the united red and white rose of England. In the
  centre of the collar is an Imperial crown from which depends the badge of
  the order, this being an onyx cameo of the effigy of her late Majesty
  Queen Victoria within the motto of the order, and surmounted by a star,
  the whole being richly jewelled. The surrounding of the shield by the
  circlet of the order doubtless is a consequence and follows upon the
  original custom of the armorial use of the garter, but this being
  admitted, it is yet permissible to state that that practice came from the
  Continent, and there is little reason to doubt that the real meaning and
  origin of the custom of using the circlet is derived from the Continental
  practice which has for long been usual of displaying the shield of arms
  upon the star of an order of knighthood. The star of every British
  order&mdash;the Garter included&mdash;contains the circlet and motto of
  the order, and it is easy to see how, after depicting the shield of arms
  upon the star of the order, the result will be that the circlet of the
  order surrounds the shield. No armorial warrant upon the point is ever
  issued at the creation of an order; the thing follows as a matter of
  course, the circlet being taken from the star to surround the shield
  without further authorisation. Upon this point <!-- Page 566 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="626.png"><a name="page566"></a>{566}</span>there
  can be no doubt, inasmuch as the garter which surrounds the shield of a
  K.G. is in <i>all</i> authoritative heraldic paintings buckled in the
  peculiar manner in which it is worn and in which it is depicted upon the
  star. The Star of the Thistle shows the plain circlet, the Star of St.
  Patrick the same, and the arms of a Knight of St. Patrick afford a
  curious confirmation of my contention, because whilst the motto of the
  order is specified to be, "Quis separabit," the circlet used for armorial
  purposes includes the date (<span class="sm">MDCCLXXXIII.</span>) as
  shown upon the star. The Order of the Bath, again, has a plain circlet
  upon the star, and the badges and stars of the military knights have the
  laurel wreath represented in heraldic drawings, the laurel wreath being
  absent from the stars and the shields of those who are members of the
  civil division. Now with regard to the Order of the Star of India the
  motto on the star is carried upon a representation of a ribbon which is
  tied in a curious manner, and my own opinion is that the circlet used to
  surround the shield of a G.C.S.I. or K.C.S.I. should (as in the case of
  the garter) be represented not as a simple circlet like the Bath or
  Thistle, but as a ribbon tied in the curious manner represented upon the
  star. This tying is not, however, duplicated upon the badge, and possibly
  I may be told that the circlet and its use are taken from the badge and
  not from the star. The reply to such a statement is, first, that there is
  no garter upon the badge of that order, there is no circlet on the badge
  of the Thistle, and the circlet on the badge of St. Patrick is surrounded
  by a wreath of trefoils which in that case ought to appear round the
  shield of a K.P. This wreath of trefoils is absent from the K.P. star.
  Further, no Companion of an Order is permitted to use the Circlet of the
  Order, whilst every Companion has his badge. No Companion has a star.
  Though I hold strongly that the circlet of the Star of India should be a
  ribbon tied as represented on the star of the order, I must admit I have
  never yet come across an official instance of it being so represented.
  This, however, is a point upon which there is no definite warrant of
  instruction, and is not the conclusion justifiable that on this matter
  the officers of arms have been led into a mistake in their general
  practice by an oversight and possible unfamiliarity with the actual star?
  A Knight Grand Commander is entitled to claim a grant of supporters on
  payment of the fees. A Knight Commander encircles his shield with the
  circlet of the order and hangs his badge from a ribbon below, a Companion
  of the Order simply hangs the badge he wears below his shield.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">The Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St.
  George.</span>&mdash;This order again is divided into three
  classes&mdash;Knights Grand Cross, Knights Commanders, and Companions.
  Knights Grand Cross place the circlet of the order and the collar with
  the badge around their shields, <!-- Page 567 --><span class="pagenum" title="627.png"
  ><a name="page567"></a>{567}</span>and, like other Knights Grand Cross,
  they are entitled to claim a grant of supporters. The circlet of the
  order is of blue edged with gold, and bearing in gold letters the motto
  of the order, "Auspicium melioris ævi." The collar is composed
  alternately of lions of England, of Maltese crosses, and of the ciphers
  S.M. and S.G., and having in the centre an Imperial crown over two lions
  passant guardant, each holding a bunch of seven arrows. At the opposite
  point of the collar are two similar lions. The whole is of gold except
  the crosses, which are of white enamel, and the various devices are
  linked together by small gold chains. Knights Commanders of the Order
  encircle their shields with a similar circlet of the order, and hang
  their badges below. A Companion simply suspends his badge from a ribbon
  below his shield.</p>

  <p><i>The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire.</i>&mdash;This order
  is divided into three classes&mdash;Knights Grand Commanders, Knights
  Commanders, and Companions. Knights Grand Commanders and Knights
  Commanders encircle their shields with the circlet of the order, which is
  of purple inscribed in letters of gold, with the motto of the order,
  "Imperatricis auspiciis." The collar of the order, which is used by the
  Knights Grand Commanders, in addition to the circle, is composed of
  elephants, lotus flowers, peacocks in their pride, and Indian roses, and
  in the centre is an Imperial crown, the whole being linked together by
  chains of gold. Knights Commanders suspend their badges from their
  shields. Companions are only permitted to suspend their badges from a
  ribbon, and, as in the cases of the other orders, are not allowed to make
  use of the circlet of the order.</p>

  <p><i>The Royal Victorian Order</i> is divided into five classes, and is
  the only British order of which this can be said. There is no collar
  belonging to the order, so a G.C.V.O. cannot put one round his shield.
  Knights Grand Cross surround their shields with the circlet of the order,
  which is of dark blue carrying in letters of gold the motto, "Victoria."
  Knights Commanders and Commanders also use the circlet, with the badge
  suspended from the ribbon. Members of the fourth and fifth classes of the
  Order suspend the badge which they are entitled to wear below their
  shields. The "Victorian Chain" is quite apart from the Victorian Order,
  and up to the present time has only been conferred upon a very limited
  number. It apparently exists by the pleasure of His Majesty, no statutes
  having been ordained.</p>

  <p>The Distinguished Service Order, the Imperial Service Order, and the
  Order of Merit are each of but one class only, none of them conferring
  the dignity of knighthood. They rank heraldically with the Companions of
  the other Orders, and for heraldic purposes merely confer upon those
  people entitled to the decorations the right to <!-- Page 568 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="628.png"><a name="page568"></a>{568}</span>suspend
  the badges they wear below their shields or lozenges as the case may be,
  following the rules observed by other Companions. The Victoria Cross, the
  Albert Medal, the Edward Medal, the Conspicuous Service Cross, the
  Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, the Royal Red Cross, the Volunteer Officers'
  Decoration, the Territorial Decoration, and the Decoration of the League
  of Mercy all rank as decorations. Though none confer any style or
  precedence of knighthood, those entitled to them are permitted to suspend
  representations of such decorations as are enjoyed below their
  shields.</p>

  <p>The members of the Orders of Victoria and Albert and of the Crown of
  India are permitted to display the badges they wear below their
  lozenges.</p>

  <p>Some people, notably in the early part of the nineteenth century,
  adopted the practice of placing war medals below the escutcheons amongst
  other decorations. It is doubtful, however, how far this practice is
  correct, inasmuch as a medal does not technically rank as a decoration or
  as a matter of honour. That medals are "decorations" is not officially
  recognised, with the exception, perhaps, of the Jubilee medal, the
  Diamond Jubilee medal, and the Coronation medal, which have been given a
  status more of the character of a decoration than of simple medals.</p>

  <p><i>The Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in England</i>
  does not rank with other orders or decorations, inasmuch as it was
  initiated without Royal intervention, and carries no precedence or
  titular rank. In 1888, however, a Royal charter of incorporation was
  obtained, and the distribution of the highest offices of the order in the
  persons of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and other members of the
  Royal Family has of late years very much increased its social status. The
  Order is, however, now recognised to a certain extent, and its insignia
  is worn at Court by duly appointed authority. The Crown is gradually
  acquiring a right of veto, which will probably eventually result in the
  order becoming a recognised honour, of which the gift lies with the
  Crown. In the charter of incorporation, Knights of Justice and Ladies of
  Justice were permitted to place as a chief over their arms the
  augmentation anciently used by knights of the English language of the
  original Roman Catholic Celibate Order. The chief used is: "Gules,
  charged with a cross throughout argent, the cross embellished in its
  angles with lions passant guardant and unicorns passant alternately both
  or," as in the cross of the order. The omission, which is all the more
  inexplicable owing to the fact that Garter King of Arms is the officer
  for the order, that the heraldic provisions of this charter have never
  been conveyed, as should have been the case, in a Royal Warrant to the
  Earl Marshal, has caused some <!-- Page 569 --><span class="pagenum" title="629.png"
  ><a name="page569"></a>{569}</span>confusion, for the officers of the
  College of Arms, when speaking officially, decline to admit the insignia
  of the order in any official emblazonment of arms. Lyon King of Arms has
  been less punctilious.</p>

  <p>Knights of Justice, Knights of Grace, and Esquires of the Orders all
  suspend the badges they wear from a black watered-silk ribbon below their
  shields (Fig. 334), and Ladies of Justice and Ladies of Grace do the same
  below their lozenges. The arms of members of the Order are frequently
  depicted superimposed upon the Cross. By the Statutes of the Order
  Knights of Justice were required to show that all their four grandparents
  were legally entitled to bear arms, but so many provisions for the
  exercise of discretion in dispensing with this requirement were at the
  same time created that to all intents and purposes such a regulation
  might never have been included. Some of the Knights of Justice even yet
  have no arms at all, others are themselves grantees, and still others
  would be unable to show what is required of them if the claims of their
  grandparents were properly investigated.</p>

  <p>It should perhaps be stated that supporters, when granted to Knights
  Grand Cross as such, are personal to themselves, and in the patents by
  which they are granted the grant is made for life only, no hereditary
  limitation being added.</p>

  <p>Any person in this country holding a Royal Licence to wear the
  insignia of any foreign order is permitted to adopt any heraldic form,
  decoration, or display which that order confers in the country of origin.
  Official recognition exists for this, and many precedents can be
  quoted.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The rules which exist in foreign countries concerning heraldic
  privileges of the knights of different orders are very varied, and it is
  impossible to briefly summarise them. It may, however, be stated that the
  most usual practice is to display the shield alone in the centre of the
  star (Fig. 772). As with us, the collars of the orders are placed around
  the shields, and the badges depend below, but the use of the circlet
  carrying the motto of the order is exclusively a British practice. In the
  case of some of the Orders, however, the official coat of arms of the
  order is quartered, impaled, or borne in pretence with the personal arms,
  and the cross patée of the Order of the Dannebrog is to be met with
  placed in front of a shield of quarterings, the charges thereupon
  appearing in the angles of the cross. I am not sure, however, that the
  cases which have come under my notice should not be rather considered
  <!-- Page 570 --><span class="pagenum" title="630.png"><a
  name="page570"></a>{570}</span>definite and hereditary grants of
  augmentation, this being perhaps a more probable explanation than that
  such a method of display followed as a matter of course on promotion to
  the order. The Grand Masters of the Teutonic Order quarter the arms of
  that order with those of their families. The Knights of the Order of St.
  Stephen of Tuscany bear the arms of that order in chief over their
  personal arms. Fig. 772 represents the manner in which a "Bailli-profès"
  (Grand Cross) of the real Catholic and Celibate Order of St. John of
  Malta places the chief of the order on his shield, the latter being
  imposed upon a Maltese star (this being white) and the badge of the order
  depending below. The "Knight-profès" does not use the chief of the order.
  In the German Protestant Order of Malta (formerly Bailiwick of
  Brandenburg) the Commendatores place the shield of their arms upon the
  Cross of Malta. The Knights of Justice ("Richtsritter") on the contrary
  assume the cross upon the shield itself, whilst the Knights of Grace
  suspend it from the bottom of the shield. The members of the ancient
  Order of La Cordelière formerly encircled their lozenges with a
  representation of the Cordelière, which formed a part of their habit; and
  the officers of the Ecclesiastical Orders frequently surround their
  escutcheons with rosaries from which depend crucifixes. Whether this
  latter practice, however, should be considered merely a piece of artistic
  decoration, or whether it should be regarded as an ecclesiastical matter
  or should be included within the purview of armory, I leave others to
  decide.</p>

  <p>By a curious fiction, for the origin of which it is not easy to
  definitely account, unless it is a survival of the celibacy required in
  certain orders, a knight is not supposed to share the insignia of any
  order of knighthood with his wife. There is not the slightest doubt that
  his own knighthood does confer upon her both precedence and titular rank,
  and why there should be any necessity for the statement to be made as to
  the theoretical position has long been a puzzle to me. Such a theory,
  however, is considered to be correct, and as a consequence in modern
  times it has become a rigid rule that the arms of the wife of a knight
  must not be impaled upon a shield when it is displayed within the circlet
  of an order. No such rule existed in ancient times, and many instances
  can be found in which impaled shields, or the shield of the wife only,
  are met with inside a representation of the Garter. In the warrant
  recently issued for Queen Alexandra the arms of England and Denmark are
  impaled within a Garter. This may be quite exceptional and consequent
  upon the fact that Her Majesty is herself a member of the Order.
  Nevertheless, the modern idea is that when a Knight of any Order impales
  the arms of his wife, he must use two shields placed accollé, the dexter
  <!-- Page 571 --><span class="pagenum" title="631.png"><a
  name="page571"></a>{571}</span>surmounting the sinister (Fig. 745). Upon
  the dexter shield is represented the arms of the knight within the
  circlet, or the circlet and collar, as the case may be, of his order; on
  the sinister shield the arms of the knight are impaled with those of his
  wife, and this shield, for the purpose of artistic balance, is usually
  surrounded with a meaningless and inartistic floral or laurel wreath to
  make its size similar to the dimensions of the dexter shield.</p>

  <p>The widow of a knight of any Order is required at present to
  immediately discontinue the use of the ensigns of that Order, and to
  revert to the plain impaled lozenge which she would be entitled to as the
  widow of an undecorated gentleman. As she retains her titular rank, such
  a regulation seems absurd, but it undoubtedly exists, and until it is
  altered must be conformed to.</p>

  <p>Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders, as also Knights Bachelors,
  use the open affronté helmet of a knight. Companions of any order, and
  members of those orders which do not confer any precedence or title of
  knighthood, use only the close profile helmet of a gentleman. A Knight
  Bachelor, of course, is at liberty to impale the arms of his wife upon
  his escutcheon without employing the double form. It only makes the use
  of the double escutcheon for Knights of Orders the more
  incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>Reference should also be made to the subject of impalement, which will
  be found in the chapter upon Marshalling. <!-- Page 572 --><span

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXV</h5>

<h5>THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF A LADY</h5>

  <p>Bearing in mind that armory was so deeply interwoven with all that was
  best in chivalry, it is curious that the armorial status of a woman
  should have been left so undefined. A query as to how a lady may bear
  arms will be glibly answered for her as maid (Fig. 749) and as widow
  (Figs. 750, 751, and 752) by the most elementary heraldic text-book. But
  a little consideration will show how far short our knowledge falls of a
  complete or uniform set of rules.</p>

  <p>Let what is definitely known be first stated. In the first place, no
  woman (save a Sovereign) can inherit, use, or transmit crest or motto,
  nor may she use a helmet or mantling. All daughters, if unmarried, bear
  <i>upon a lozenge</i> the paternal arms and quarterings of their father,
  with his difference marks. If their mother were an heiress, they quarter
  her arms with those of her father. In England (save in the Royal Family,
  and in this case even it is a matter of presumption only) there is no
  seniority amongst daughters, and the difference marks of all daughters
  are those borne by the father, and none other. There are no marks of
  distinction as between the daughters themselves. In Scotland, however,
  seniority does exist, according to priority of birth; and, though
  Scottish heraldic law provides no marks of cadency as between sister and
  sister, the laws of arms north of the Tweed recognise seniority of birth
  in the event of a certain set of circumstances arising.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, as doubtless many are aware, certain untitled Scottish
  families, for reasons which may or may not be known, have been permitted
  to use supporters to their arms. When the line vests in coheirs, the
  eldest born daughter, as heir of line, assumes the supporters, unless
  some other limitation has been attached to them. Scottish supporters are
  peculiar things to deal with, unless the exact terms of the patent of
  grant or matriculation are known.</p>

  <p>The lozenge of an unmarried lady is frequently surmounted by a true
  lover's knot of ribbon, usually painted blue (Fig. 749). It has no
  particular meaning and no official recognition, though plenty of official
  <!-- Page 573 --><span class="pagenum" title="633.png"><a
  name="page573"></a>{573}</span>use, and practically its status is no more
  than a piece of supposedly artistic ornament.</p>

  <p>Concerning the law for unmarried ladies, therefore, there is neither
  doubt nor dispute. A widow bears arms upon a lozenge, this showing the
  arms of her late husband impaled with those of her own family (Fig. 750),
  or with these latter displayed on an escutcheon of pretence if she be an
  heir or coheir (Fig. 751).</p>

  <p>The other state in the progress of life in which a lady may hope or
  expect to find herself is that of married life. Now, how should a married
  lady display arms? Echo and the text-books alike answer, "How?" Does
  <i>anybody</i> know? This "fault," for such it undoubtedly is, is due to
  the fact that the laws of arms evolved themselves in that period when a
  married woman was little accounted of. As an unmarried heiress she
  undoubtedly was a somebody; as a widowed and richly-jointured dowager she
  was likewise of account, but as a wedded wife her identity was lost, for
  the Married Women's Property Act was not in existence, nor was it thought
  of. So completely was it recognised that all rights and inheritance of
  the wife devolved of right upon the husband, that formerly the husband
  enjoyed any peerage honours which had descended to the wife, and was
  summoned to Parliament as a peer in his wife's peerage. Small wonder,
  then, that the same ideas dominated the rules of armory. These only
  provide ways and methods for the husband to bear the wife's arms. This is
  curious, because there can be no doubt that at a still earlier period the
  practice of impalement was entirely confined to women, and that, unless
  the wife happened to be an heiress, the husband did not trouble to impale
  her arms. But a little thought will show that the two are not at
  variance, for if monuments and other matters of <i>record</i> are
  ignored, the earliest examples of impalement which have come down to us
  are all, almost without exception, examples of arms borne by widows. One
  cannot get over the fact that a wife during coverture had practically no
  legal status at all. The rules governing impalement, and the conjunction
  of the arms of man and wife, as they are to be borne by the husband, are
  recited in the chapter upon Marshalling, which also details the ways in
  which a widow bears arms in the different ranks of life. Nothing would be
  gained by repeating them here.</p>

  <p>It may be noted, however, that it is not considered correct for a
  widow to make use of the true lover's knot of blue ribbon, which is
  sometimes used in the case of an unmarried lady. A divorce puts matters
  <i>in statu quo ante</i>.</p>

  <p>There still remains, however, the question of the bearing of arms in
  her own right by a married woman under coverture at the present day. <!--

  <p>The earliest grant of arms that I can put my hands upon to a woman is
  one dated 1558. It is, moreover, the only grant of which I know to one
  single person, that person being a <i>wife</i>. The grant is decidedly
  interesting, so I print it in full:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In this grant the arms are painted upon a <i>shield</i>. The grant was
  made in her husband's lifetime, but his arms are not impaled therewith.
  Evidently, therefore, the lady bears arms <i>in her own right</i>, and
  the presumption would seem to be that a married lady bears her arms
  without reference to her husband, and bears them upon a shield. On the
  other hand, the grant to Lady Pearce, referred to on an earlier page,
  whilst not blazoning the Pearce arms, shows the painting upon the patent
  to have been a lozenge of the arms of Pearce, charged with a baronet's
  hand impaled with the arms then granted for the maiden name of Lady
  Pearce. On the other hand, a grant is printed in vol. i. of the Notes to
  the "Visitation of England and Wales." The grant is to Dame Judith Diggs,
  widow of Sir Maurice Diggs, Bart., now wife of Daniel Sheldon, and to
  Dame Margaret Sheldon, her sister, relict of Sir Joseph Sheldon, Knight,
  late Alderman, and sometime Lord Mayor of the City of London, daughters
  and coheirs of Mr. George Rose, of Eastergate. The operative clause of
  the grant is: "do by these Presents grant and assign to y<sup>e</sup>
  said Dame Judith and Dame Margaret the Armes hereafter mentioned
  Viz<sup>t</sup>: Ermine, an Eagle displayed Sable, membered and beaked
  Gules, debruised with a Bendlet Componè Or and Azure, as in the margin
  hereof more plainly appears depicted. To be borne and used for ever
  hereafter by them y<sup>e</sup> said Dame Judith Diggs and Dame Margaret
  Sheldon, and the descendants of their bodies respectively, lawfully
  begotten, according to the Laws, Rules and practice of Armes."</p>

  <p>In each case it will be noted that the sisters were respectively wife
  and widow of some one of the name of Sheldon; and it might possibly be
  supposed that these were arms granted for the name of Sheldon. There
  seems, however, to be very little doubt that these are the arms for Rose.
  The painting is, however, of the single coat of Rose, and one is puzzled
  to know why the arms are not painted in <!-- Page 576 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="636.png"><a
  name="page576"></a>{576}</span>conjunction with those of Sheldon. The
  same practice was followed in the patent which was granted to Nelson's
  Lady Hamilton. This patent, which both heraldically and historically is
  excessively interesting, was printed in full on p. 168, vol. i. of the
  <i>Genealogical Magazine</i>. The arms which in the grant are
  specifically said to be the arms of Lyons (not of Hamilton) are painted
  upon a lozenge, with no reference to the arms of Hamilton. In each of
  these cases, however, the grantee of arms has been an heiress, so that
  the clause by which the arms are limited to the descendants does not
  help. An instance of a grant to a man and his wife, where the wife was
  not an heiress, is printed in "The Right to Bear Arms"; and in this case
  the painting shows the arms impaled with those of the husband. The grant
  to the wife has no hereditary limitations, and presumably her descendants
  would never be able to quarter the arms of the wife, no matter even if by
  the extinction of the other issue she eventually became a coheir. The
  fact that the arms of man and wife are herein granted together prevents
  any one making any deduction as to what is the position of the wife
  alone.</p>

  <p>There was a patent issued in the year 1784 to a Mrs. Sarah Lax, widow
  of John Lax, to take the name and arms of Maynard, such name and arms to
  be borne by herself and her issue. The painting in this case is of the
  arms of Maynard alone upon a lozenge, and the crest which was to be borne
  by her male descendants is quite a separate painting in the body of the
  grant, and not in conjunction with the lozenge. Now, Mrs. Maynard was a
  widow, and it is manifestly wrong that she should bear the arms as if she
  were unmarried, yet how was she to bear them? She was bearing the name of
  Lax because that had been her husband's name, and she took the name of
  Maynard, which presumably her husband would have taken had he been alive;
  she herself was a Miss Jefferson, so would she have been entitled to have
  placed the arms of Jefferson upon an escutcheon of pretence, in the
  centre of the arms of Maynard? Presumably she would, because suppose the
  husband had assumed the name and arms of Maynard in his lifetime, he
  certainly would have been entitled to place his wife's arms of Jefferson
  on an escutcheon of pretence.</p>

  <p>On March 9, 1878, Francis Culling Carr, and his second wife, Emily
  Blanche, daughter of Andrew Morton Carr, and niece of the late
  Field-Marshal Sir William Maynard Gomm, G.C.B., both assumed by Royal
  Licence the additional surname and arms of Gomm. Neither Mr. nor Mrs.
  Carr-Gomm appear to have had any blood descent from the Gomm family;
  consequently the Gomm arms were granted to both husband and wife, and the
  curious part is that they were not identical, the marks (showing that
  there was no blood relationship) being a <!-- Page 577 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="637.png"><a name="page577"></a>{577}</span>canton
  for the husband and a cross crosslet for the wife. In this case the arms
  were impaled. One is puzzled to know why the grant to the wife was
  necessary as well as the grant to the husband.</p>

  <p>In 1865 Mrs. Massy, widow of Hugh Massy, assumed the name and arms of
  Richardson in lieu of Massy. Mrs. Massy was the only child of Major
  Richardson Brady, who had previously assumed by Royal Licence the arms of
  Brady only. The painting upon the patent is a lozenge, bearing the arms
  of Massy, and upon an escutcheon of pretence the arms of Richardson. Of
  course, the arms of Mrs. Massy, as a widow, previously to the issue of
  the Royal Licence were a lozenge of the arms of Massy, and on an
  escutcheon of pretence the arms of Brady.</p>

  <p>A few years ago a Grant of Arms was issued to a Mrs. Sharpe, widow of
  Major Sharpe. The arms were <i>to be borne by herself</i> and the
  descendants of her late husband, and by the other descendants of her
  husband's father, so that there is no doubt whatever that these were the
  arms of Sharpe. I have no idea who Mrs. Sharpe was, and I do not know
  that she possessed any arms of her own. Let us presume she did not. Now,
  unless a widow may bear the arms of her late husband on a lozenge,
  whether she has arms to impale with them or not, how on earth is she to
  bear arms at all? And yet the grant most distinctly was primarily to Mrs.
  Sharpe.</p>

  <p>After the death of General Ross, the victor of Bladensburg, a grant of
  an augmentation was made to be placed upon the monument to the memory of
  the General (Plate II.). The grant also was for the augmentation to be
  borne by his widow during her widowhood. But no mention appears of the
  arms of Mrs. Ross, nor, as far as I can ascertain, was proof officially
  made that Mrs. Ross was in her own right entitled to arms; consequently,
  whether she really was or was not, we may assume that as far as the
  official authorities officially knew she was not, and the same query
  formulated with regard to the Sharpe patent holds good in this case. The
  painting on the patent shows the arms upon a shield, and placed above is
  a helmet surmounted by the crest of augmentation and the family crest of
  Ross.</p>

  <p>So that from the cases we have mentioned instances can be found of the
  arms of a wife upon a shield alone, and of a widow having arms depicted
  upon a lozenge, such arms being on different occasions the impaled arms
  of her husband and herself, or the arms of herself alone or of her
  husband alone; and we have arms granted to a wife, and depicted as an
  impalement or upon a lozenge. So that from grants it seems almost
  impossible to deduce any decided and unquestionable rule as to how wife
  or widow should bear a coat of arms. There is, <!-- Page 578 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="638.png"><a
  name="page578"></a>{578}</span>however, one other source from which
  profitable instruction may be drawn. I refer to the methods of depicting
  arms upon hatchments, and more particularly to the hatchment of a married
  woman. Now a hatchment is strictly and purely personal, and in the days
  when the use of such an article was an everyday matter, the greatest
  attention was paid to the proper marshalling of the arms thereupon. There
  are so many varying circumstances that we have here only space to refer
  to the three simple rules, and these uncomplicated by any exceptional
  circumstances, which governed the hatchments of maid, wife, and widow. In
  the first case, the hatchment of an unmarried lady showed the whole of
  the background black, the paternal arms on a lozenge, and this suspended
  by a knot of blue ribbon. In the hatchment of a widow the background
  again was all black, the arms were upon a lozenge (but without the knot
  of ribbon), and the lozenge showed the arms of husband and wife impaled,
  or with the wife's in pretence, as circumstances might dictate. The
  hatchment of a wife was entirely different. Like the foregoing, it was
  devoid, of course, of helmet, mantling, crest, or motto; but the
  background was white on the dexter side (to show that the husband was
  still alive), and black on the sinister (to show the wife was dead). But
  the impaled arms were not depicted upon a lozenge, but upon a shield, and
  the shield was surmounted by the true lover's knot of blue ribbon.</p>

  <p>I have already stated that when the rules of arms were in the making
  the possibility of a married woman bearing arms in her own right was
  quite ignored, and theoretically even now the husband bears his wife's
  arms for her upon his shield. But the arms of a man are never depicted
  suspended from a true lover's knot. Such a display is distinctly
  feminine, and I verily believe that the correct way for a married woman
  to use arms, if she desires the display thereof to be personal to herself
  rather than to her husband, is to place her husband's arms impaled with
  her own upon a shield suspended from a true lover's knot, and without
  helmet, mantling, crest, or motto. At any rate such a method of display
  is a correct one, it is in no way open to criticism on the score of
  inaccuracy, it has precedent in its favour, and it affords a very
  desirable means of distinction. My only hesitation is that one cannot say
  it is the only way, or that it would be "incorrect" for the husband. At
  any rate it is the only way of drawing a distinction between the
  "married" achievements of the husband and the wife.</p>

  <p>The limitations attached to a lady's heraldic display being what they
  are, it has long been felt, and keenly felt, by every one attempting
  heraldic design, that artistic treatment of a lady's arms savoured almost
  of the impossible. What delicacy of treatment can possibly be added to
  the hard outline of the lozenge? The substitution of curvilinear for <!--
  Page 579 --><span class="pagenum" title="639.png"><a
  name="page579"></a>{579}</span>straight lines in the outline, and even
  the foliation of the outline, goes but a little way as an equivalent to
  the extensive artistic opportunities which the mantling affords to a
  designer when depicting the arms of a man.</p>

  <p>To a certain extent, two attempts have been made towards providing a
  remedy. Neither can properly claim <i>official</i> recognition, though
  both have been employed in a quasi-official manner. The one consists of
  the knot of ribbon; the other consists of the use of the cordelière. In
  their present usage the former is meaningless and practically senseless,
  whilst the use of the latter is radically wrong, and in my opinion,
  little short of imposture. The knot of ribbon, when employed, is usually
  in the form of a thin streamer of blue ribbon tied in the conventional
  true lover's knot (Fig. 749). But the imbecility and inconsistency of its
  use lies in the fact that except upon a hatchment it has been denied by
  custom to married women and widows, who have gained their lovers; whilst
  its use is sanctioned for the unmarried lady, who, unless she be
  affianced, neither has nor ought to have anything whatever to do with
  lovers or with their knot. The women who are fancy-free display the
  tied-up knot; women whom love has fast tied up, unless the foregoing
  opinion as to the correct way to display the arms of a married lady which
  I have expressed be correct, must leave the knot alone. But as matters
  stand heraldically at the moment the ribbon may be used advantageously
  with the lozenge of an unmarried lady.</p>

  <p>With reference to the cordelière some writers assert that its use is
  optional, others that its use is confined to widow ladies. Now as a
  matter of fact it is nothing whatever of the kind. It is really the
  insignia of the old French Order of the Cordelière, which was founded by
  Anne of Bretagne, widow of Charles VIII., in 1498, its membership being
  confined to widow ladies of noble family. The cordelière was the waist
  girdle which formed a part of the insignia of the Order, and it took its
  place around the lozenges of the arms of the members in a manner similar
  to the armorial use of the Garter for Knights of that Order. Though the
  Order of the Cordelière is long since extinct, it is neither right nor
  proper that any part of its insignia should be adopted unaltered by those
  who can show no connection with it or membership of it. <!-- Page 580

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXVI</h5>

<h5>OFFICIAL HERALDIC INSIGNIA</h5>

  <p>The armory of all other nations than our own is rich in heraldic
  emblems of office. In France this was particularly the case, and France
  undoubtedly for many centuries gave the example, to be followed by other
  civilised countries, in all matters of honour and etiquette.</p>

  <p>If English heraldry were entirely destitute of official heraldic
  ensigns, perhaps the development elsewhere of this branch of armory might
  be dismissed as an entirely foreign growth. But this is far from being
  the case, as there are some number of cases in which these official
  emblems do exist. In England, however, the instances are governed by no
  scale of comparative importance, and the appearance of such tokens can
  only be described as capricious. That a more extended usage might with
  advantage be made no one can deny, for usage of this character would
  teach the general public that armory had a meaning and a value, it would
  increase the interest in heraldry, and also assist greatly in the rapidly
  increasing revival of heraldic knowledge. The existence of these heraldic
  emblems would manifestly tend towards a revival of the old and
  interestingly excellent custom of regularly setting up in appropriate
  public places the arms of those who have successively held various
  offices. The Inns of Court, St. George's Chapel, the Public Office at the
  College of Arms, and the halls of some of the Livery Companies are
  amongst the few places of importance where the custom still obtains. And
  yet what an interesting memorial such a series always becomes! The
  following list may not be entirely complete, but it is fairly so as far
  as France is concerned, and I think also complete as to England.</p>

  <p>The following are from the Royal French Court:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The High Constable of France</i>: Two swords held on each side of
  the shield by two hands in armour issuing from the clouds.</p>

  <p><i>The Chancellor</i>: In saltire behind his arms two great maces, and
  over his helmet a mortier or cap sable crossed by two bands of gold lace
  and turned up ermine; thereon the figure of a demi-queen as an emblem of
  France, holding a sceptre in her right hand and the great seal of the
  kingdom in her left. <!-- Page 581 --><span class="pagenum" title="641.png"
  ><a name="page581"></a>{581}</span></p>

  <p><i>The Marshal</i>: Two batons in saltire behind the arms azure,
  semé-de-lis or.</p>

  <p><i>The Admiral</i>: Two anchors in saltire behind the arms, the stocks
  of the anchors in chief azure, semé-de-lis or.</p>

  <p><i>The General of the Galleys</i>: Two anchors in saltire behind the
  arms.</p>

  <p><i>Vice-Admiral</i>: One anchor in pale behind the arms.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel-General of the Infantry</i>: Under his arms in saltire six
  flags, three on each side, white, crimson, and blue.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel of the Cavalry</i>: Over the arms four banners of the arms
  of France, fringed, &amp;c., two to the dexter and two to the
  sinister.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Master of the Artillery</i>: Two field-pieces of ordnance
  under the arms, one pointing to the dexter and one to the sinister.</p>

  <p><i>The Superintendent of the Finance</i>: Two keys imperially crowned
  and endorsed in pale, one on each side of the arms, the dexter or, the
  sinister argent.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Master of the Household to the King</i>: Two grand batons of
  silver gilt in saltire behind the arms.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Almoner</i>: Under his arms a blue book, on the cover the
  arms of France and Navarre within the Orders of St. Michael and the Holy
  Ghost, over the Orders the Crown.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Chamberlain</i>: Two keys, both imperially crowned or, in
  saltire behind the arms endorsed, the wards-in-chief.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Esquire</i>: On each side of the shield a royal sword erect,
  the scabbard azure, semé-de-lis, hilt and pommel or, the belts folded
  round the scabbard azure, semé-de-lis or.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Pannetier</i>, who by virtue of his office had all the bakers
  of Paris under his jurisdiction, and had to lay the king's cover at his
  table, bore under his arms a rich cover and a knife and fork in
  saltire.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Butler or Cupbearer</i>: On each side of the base of the
  shield, a grand silver flagon gilt, with the arms of the King
  thereon.</p>

  <p><i>Gamekeeper to the King</i>: Two bugle-horns appending from the ends
  of the mantling.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Falconer</i>: Two lures appending from the ends of the
  mantling.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Wolf-hunter</i>: On each side of the shield a wolf's head
  caboshed.</p>

  <p><i>Captain of the King's Guards</i>: Two small batons sable, headed
  gold, like a walking-cane.</p>

  <p><i>Captain of the Hundred Swiss Guards</i>: Two batons in saltire
  sable, headed argent, and under the arms two black velvet caps with
  feathers.</p>

  <p><i>First Master of the Household</i>: Under his arms two batons in
  saltire.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Carver to His Majesty</i>: Under his arms a knife and fork in
  saltire proper, the handles azure, semé-de-lis or. <!-- Page 582 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="642.png"><a name="page582"></a>{582}</span></p>

  <p><i>Grand Provost of the Household</i>: Under his arms two Roman fasces
  or, corded azure.</p>

  <p><i>Grand Quartermaster</i>: A mace and battle-axe in saltire.</p>

  <p><i>Captain of the Guards of the Gate</i>: Two keys in pale, crowned
  argent, one on each side the arms.</p>

  <p><i>The President of the Parliament</i>: On his helmet a black cap with
  two bands of gold lace.</p>

  <p>Under the Empire (of France) the Vice-Connétable used arms holding
  swords, as had been the case with the Constable of the Kingdom, but the
  swords were sheathed and semé of golden bees. The Grand Chamberlain had
  two golden keys in saltire, the bows thereof enclosing the imperial
  eagle, and the batons of the Maréchaux de French were semé of bees
  instead of fleurs-de-lis.</p>

  <p>The Pope bears a cross with three arms, an archbishop one with two
  arms, a bishop one with a single arm. Besides this, two crossed keys
  appertain to the Pope, the golden key to bind, in bend dexter, the silver
  key to loose, in sinister bend. British archbishops and bishops will be
  presently referred to. Ecclesiastical princes, who were at the same time
  sovereign territorial princes, bore behind their shield a pedum or
  pastorale (crosier), crossed with the sword of penal judicature. A bishop
  bears the crosier with an outward bend, an abbot with an inward bend,
  thus symbolising the range of their activity or dominion. The arch and
  hereditary offices of the old German Empire had also their own
  attributes; thus the "Erztruchsess," Lord High Steward
  (Palatinate-Bavaria), bore a golden Imperial globe, which arose from a
  misinterpretation of the double dish, the original attribute of this
  dignity. The Lord High Marshal of the Empire (Saxony) expressed his
  office by a shield divided "per fess argent and sable," bearing two
  crossed swords gules. The Hereditary Standard-bearer (Würtemberg) bore:
  "Azure, a banner or, charged with an eagle sable"; the Lord High
  Chamberlain (Brandenburg): "Azure, a sceptre or," while the Hereditary
  Chamberlain (Hohenzollern) used: "Gules, two crossed sceptres or."</p>

  <p>In Italy the Duca de Savelli, as Marshal of the Conclave, hangs on
  either side of his shield a key, the cords of which are knotted beneath
  his coronet.</p>

  <p>In Holland Admirals used the naval Crown, and added two anchors in
  saltire behind the shield.</p>

  <p>In Spain the Admirals of Castile and of the Indies placed an anchor in
  bend behind the shield.</p>

  <p>The instances I am aware of which have official sanction already in
  this country are as stated in the list which follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I have purposely (to make the list absolutely complete) included <!--
  Page 583 --><span class="pagenum" title="643.png"><a
  name="page583"></a>{583}</span>insignia which may possibly be more
  properly considered ensigns of rank, because it is not particularly easy
  always to distinguish offices from honours and from rank.</p>

  <p><i>The Kings of England</i> (George I. to William IV.), as Arch
  Treasurers of the Holy Roman Empire, bore: Upon an inescutcheon gules, in
  the centre of the arms of Hanover, a representation of the Crown of
  Charlemagne.</p>

  <p><i>An Archbishop</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms, which he
  impales (placing it on the dexter side) with his personal arms; (2) his
  mitre, which, it should be noted, is the same as the mitre of a Bishop,
  and <i>not</i> having a coronet encircling its band; (3) his
  archiepiscopal staff (of gold, and with two transverse arms), which is
  placed in pale behind his escutcheon; (4) two crosiers in saltire behind
  the escutcheon. It is curious to note that the pallium which occurs in
  all archiepiscopal coats of arms (save that of York) is now very
  generally conceded to have been more in the nature of an emblem of the
  <i>rank</i> of Archbishop (it being a part of his ecclesiastical costume)
  than a charge in a concrete impersonal coat of arms for a defined area of
  archiepiscopal jurisdiction. In this connection it is interesting to
  observe that the Archbishops of York anciently used the pallium in lieu
  of the official arms now regularly employed.</p>

  <p><i>A Bishop</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms, (2) his mitre, (3)
  two crosiers in saltire behind his escutcheon.</p>

  <p><i>The Bishop of Durham</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms, (2)
  his coronetted mitre, <i>which is peculiar to himself</i>, and (which is
  another privilege also peculiar to himself alone) he places a
  <i>sword</i> and a crosier in saltire behind his arms. Reference should
  also be made to the chapter upon Ecclesiastical Heraldry.</p>

  <p><i>A Peer</i> has: (1) His coronet, (2) his helmet of rank; (3) his
  supporters, (4) his robe of estate.</p>

  <p><i>A Scottish Peer</i> has, in addition, the ermine lining to his
  mantling.</p>

  <p><i>A Baronet of England</i>, of Ireland, of Great Britain, or of the
  United Kingdom has: (1) His helmet of rank, (2) his badge of Ulster upon
  an inescutcheon or canton (argent, a sinister hand erect, couped at the
  wrist gules).</p>

  <p><i>A Baronet of Nova Scotia</i> has: (1) His helmet of rank, (2) his
  badge (an orange tawny ribbon, whereon shall hang pendent in an
  escutcheon argent, a saltire azure, thereon an inescutcheon of the arms
  of Scotland, with an imperial crown over the escutcheon, and encircled
  with this motto, "Fax Mentis Honestæ Gloria," pendent below the
  escutcheon).</p>

  <p><i>A Knight of the Garter</i> has: (1) His Garter to encircle the
  shield, (2) his collar and badge, (3) supporters. The Prelate of the
  Order of <!-- Page 584 --><span class="pagenum" title="644.png"><a
  name="page584"></a>{584}</span>the Garter (an office held by the Bishops
  of Winchester) is entitled to encircle his arms with the Garter. The
  Chancellor of the Order of the Garter encircles his arms with the Garter.
  Formerly the Bishops of Salisbury always held this office, but in 1836
  when the county of Berks (which of course includes Windsor, and therefore
  the chapel of the order) was removed from the Diocese of Salisbury to the
  Diocese of Oxford, the office of Chancellor passed to the Bishops of
  Oxford. The Dean of Windsor, as Registrar of the Order, displays below
  his shield the ribbon and badge of his office.</p>

  <p><i>A Knight of the Thistle</i> has: (1) The ribbon or circlet of the
  order, (2) his collar and badge, (3) supporters. The Dean of the Chapels
  Royal in Scotland, as Dean of the Order, used the badge and ribbon of his
  office.</p>

  <p><i>A Knight of St. Patrick</i> has: (1) The ribbon or circlet of the
  order, (2) his collar and badge, (3) supporters. The Prelate of the Order
  of St. Patrick was as such entitled to encircle his escutcheon with the
  ribbon or circlet of that order, from which his official badge depends.
  The office, of course, came to an end with the disestablishment of the
  Irish Church. It was held by the Archbishops of Armagh. The Chancellor of
  the Order of St. Patrick is as such entitled to encircle his escutcheon
  with the ribbon or circlet of that order, from which his official badge
  depends. This office, formerly held by the Archbishops of Dublin, has
  since the disestablishment been enjoyed by the Chief Secretaries for
  Ireland. The Deans of St. Patrick's were similarly Registrars of the
  Order, and as such used the badge and ribbon of their office.</p>

  <p><i>Knights Grand Cross</i> or <i>Knights Grand Commanders</i> of the
  Orders of the Bath, the Star of India, St. Michael and St. George, the
  Indian Empire, or the Victorian Order, have: (1) The circlets or ribbons
  of their respective Orders, (2) their collars and badges, (3) their
  helmets of degree, (4) supporters, if they incline to pay the fees for
  these to be granted.</p>

  <p><i>Knights Commanders</i> of the aforesaid Orders have: (1) The
  circlets or ribbons of their respective Orders, (2) their badges pendent
  below the shield, (3) their helmets of degree.</p>

  <p><i>Commanders</i> of the Victorian Order have: (1) the circlet of the
  Order, (2) the badge pendent below the shield.</p>

  <p><i>Companions</i> of the aforesaid Orders, and Members of the
  Victorian Order, as also Members of the Distinguished Service Order, the
  Imperial Service Order, the Order of Merit, the Order of Victoria and
  Albert, the Order of the Crown of India, and those entitled to the
  Victoria Cross, the Albert Medal, the Edward Medal, the Conspicuous
  Service Cross, the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, the Royal Red Cross, the <!--
  Page 585 --><span class="pagenum" title="645.png"><a
  name="page585"></a>{585}</span>Volunteer Officers' Decoration, the
  Territorial Decoration, and the Decoration of the League of Mercy, are
  entitled to suspend their respective decorations below their escutcheons.
  The officers of these orders of knighthood are of course entitled to
  display their badges of office. The Dean of Westminster is always Dean of
  the Order of the Bath.</p>

  <p><i>Knights Grand Cross</i> and<i> Knights Commanders of the Bath, if
  of the Military Division</i>, are also entitled to place a wreath of
  laurel round their escutcheons.</p>

  <p><i>Knights of Justice of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of
  Jerusalem in England</i> are entitled to place upon their escutcheons a
  chief of the arms of the Order (gules, a cross throughout argent,
  embellished in the angles with a lion guardant and a unicorn, both
  passant or).</p>

  <p><i>Knights of Grace and other Members of the Order</i> suspend
  whatever badge they are entitled to wear below their shield from a black
  watered-silk ribbon.</p>

  <p>[Some members of the Order display their arms upon the Cross of the
  Order, as was done by Knights of the original Order, from which the
  present Order is copied, but how far the practice is sanctioned by the
  Royal Charter, or in what manner it is controlled by the rules of the
  Order, I am not aware.]</p>

  <p><i>The Lord High Constable of England</i> is entitled to place behind
  his escutcheon two batons in saltire similar to the one which is
  delivered to him for use at the Coronation, which is now the only
  occasion when the office is enjoyed. As the office is only held
  temporarily, the existing privilege does not amount to much.</p>

  <p><i>The Lord High Constable of Scotland</i> is entitled to place behind
  his escutcheon, in saltire, two silver batons tipped with gold at either
  end. The arms of the Earl of Errol (Hereditary Lord High Constable of
  Scotland) have only once, at an early period, been matriculated in Lyon
  Register, and then without any official insignia, but there can be no
  doubt of the right to the crossed batons.</p>

  <p><i>The Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland</i> (I am not sure this
  office still exists): Two golden keys in saltire behind the
  escutcheon.</p>

  <p><i>The Earl Marshal and Hereditary Marshal of England</i> places two
  batons of gold tipped with sable in saltire behind his arms.</p>

  <p>[<i>A Deputy Earl Marshal</i> places one similar baton in bend behind
  his shield.]</p>

  <p><i>The Earl Marischal of Scotland</i> (until the office was
  extinguished by attainder) placed saltirewise behind his shield two
  batons gules, semé of thistles, each ensigned on the top with an Imperial
  Crown or.</p>

  <p><i>The Hereditary Marshal of Ireland</i> (an office for long past in
  abeyance) used two batons in saltire behind his arms. According to <!--
  Page 586 --><span class="pagenum" title="646.png"><a
  name="page586"></a>{586}</span>MS. Harl. 6589, f. 39: "Les armes des
  office du Mareschall d'Ireland sont de Goulz et cinque fucelles bendes
  d'Argent." These certainly do not appear to be the personal arms of those
  who held the office, but there is other record that some such coat was
  used.</p>

  <p><i>The Hereditary Lord Great Seneschal of Ireland</i> (the Earl of
  Shrewsbury) places a white wand in pale behind his escutcheon.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Argyll</i> places in saltire behind his arms: (1) In
  bend dexter, a baton gules, semé of thistles or, ensigned with an
  Imperial Crown proper, thereon the crest of Scotland (as Hereditary Great
  Master of the Household in Scotland); (2) in bend sinister, a sword
  proper, hilt and pommel or (as Hereditary Justice-General of Scotland)
  (<i>vide</i> Plate III.).</p>

  <p><i>The Master-General of the Ordnance</i> (by warrant of King Charles
  II.), bears on each side of his arms a field-piece.</p>

  <p><i>The Lord Justice-Clerk of Scotland</i> places two swords in saltire
  behind his shield.</p>

  <p><i>The Lord Chief-Justice of England</i> encircles his arms with his
  Collar of SS.</p>

  <p><i>The Walker Trustees</i> place behind their shield two batons in
  saltire, each ensigned with a unicorn salient supporting a shield argent,
  the unicorn horned or, and gorged with an antique crown, to which is
  affixed a chain passing between the fore-legs and reflexed over the back
  of the last, for the office of Heritable Usher of the White Rod of
  Scotland, now vested in the said Trustees. Before the recent Court of
  Claims the claim was made to exercise the office by deputy, and such
  claim was allowed.</p>

  <p><i>The Master of the Revels in Scotland</i> has an official coat of
  arms: Argent, a lady rising out of a cloud in the nombril point, richly
  apparelled, on her head a garland of ivy, holding in her right hand a
  poignard crowned, in her left a vizard all proper, standing under a veil
  or canopy azure garnished or, in base a thistle vert.</p>

  <p><i>Serjeants-at-Arms</i> encircle their arms with their Collars of
  SS.</p>

  <p><i>Garter King of Arms</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms (argent,
  a gules, on a chief azure, a ducal coronet encircled with a Garter,
  between a lion passant guardant on the dexter, and a fleur-de-lis on the
  sinister, all or); (2) his crown; (3) his Collar of SS (the collar of a
  King of Arms differs from that of a Herald, inasmuch as it is of
  <i>silver-gilt</i>, and on each shoulder a portcullis is inserted); (4)
  his badge as Garter pendent below his shield. His sceptre of silver-gilt
  has been sometimes placed in bend behind his escutcheon, but this has not
  been regularly done. The practice has, however, been reverted to by the
  present Garter.</p>

  <p><i>Lyon King of Arms</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms (argent, a
  lion sejant, erect and affronté gules, holding in his dexter paw a
  thistle <!-- Page 587 --><span class="pagenum" title="647.png"><a
  name="page587"></a>{587}</span>slipped vert, and in the sinister a shield
  of the second, on a chief azure a St. Andrew's cross&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a
  saltire&mdash;of the field); (2) his crown; (3) two batons, representing
  that of his office in saltire behind his shield, these being azure semé
  of thistles and fleurs-de-lis or, tipped at either end with gold; (4) his
  Collar of SS; (5) his triple chain of gold, from which depends his badge
  as Lyon King of Arms.</p>

  <p><i>Ulster King of Arms</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms (or, a
  cross gules, on a chief of the last a lion of England between a harp and
  a portcullis, all of the first); (2) his crown; (3) his Collar of SS; (4)
  his two staves in saltire behind the shield; (5) his chain and badge as
  Ulster King of Arms; (6) his badge as Registrar of the Order of St.
  Patrick.</p>

  <p><i>Clarenceux King of Arms</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms
  (argent, a cross gules, on a chief of the second a lion passant guardant
  or, crowned of the last); (2) his crown; (3) his Collar of SS.</p>

  <p><i>Norroy King of Arms</i> has: (1) His official coat of arms (argent,
  a cross gules, on a chief of the second a lion of England passant
  guardant or, crowned with an open crown, between a fleur-de-lis on the
  dexter and a key on the sinister of the last); (2) his crown; (3) his
  Collar of SS.</p>

  <p><i>Bath King of Arms</i> has: (1) His crown; his Collar of SS.</p>

  <p>I am not aware that any official arms have been assigned to Bath up to
  the present time; but if none exist, there would not be the slightest
  difficulty in obtaining these.</p>

  <p><i>An English Herald</i> encircles his shield with his Collar of
  SS.</p>

  <p><i>A Scottish Herald</i> is entitled to do the same, and has also his
  badge, which he places below the escutcheon pendent from a ribbon of blue
  and white.</p>

  <p>An <i>Irish Herald</i> has his Collar of SS, and his badge suspended
  from a sky-blue ribbon. An <i>Irish Pursuivant</i> has a similar
  badge.</p>

  <p><i>The Regius Professors (or "Readers") in the University of
  Cambridge</i>, for "Phisicke," "Lawe," "Devinity," "Hebrew," and "Greke,"
  have official arms as follows (see grant by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux,
  1590, <i>Genealogical Magazine</i>, vol. ii. p. 125):&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Of Phisicke</i>: Azure, a fesse ermines (? ermine) between three
  lozenges or, on a chief gules a lion passant guardant of the third,
  charged on the side with the letter M sable. Crest: on a wreath or and
  azure, a quinquangle silver, called "simbolum sanitatis." Mantling gules
  and argent.</p>

  <p><i>Of Lawe</i>: Purpure, a cross moline or, on a chief gules, a lion
  passant guardant of the second, charged on the side with the letter L
  sable. Crest: on a wreath "purple and gold," a bee volant or. Mantling
  gules and argent.</p>

  <p><i>Of Devinity</i>: Gules, on a cross ermine, between four doves
  argent, <!-- Page 588 --><span class="pagenum" title="648.png"><a
  name="page588"></a>{588}</span>a book of the first, the leaves or,
  charged in the midst with the Greek letter <span
  class="grk">&theta;</span> (Theta) sable. Crest: on a wreath "silver and
  gules," a dove volant argent, with an olive-branch vert in his beak.
  Mantling gules, double argent.</p>

  <p><i>Of Hebrew</i>: Argent, the Hebrew letter <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="T" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span>&#x200E; (Tawe)
  sable, on a chief gules, a lion passant guardant or, charged on the side
  with the letter H sable. Crest: on a wreath "silver and sables," a
  turtle-dove azure. Mantling gules, double argent.</p>

  <p><i>Of Greke</i>: Per chevron argent and sable, in chief the two Greek
  letters <span class="grk">&Alpha;</span> (Alpha) and <span
  class="grk">&Omega;</span> (Omega) of the second, and in base a "cicado"
  or grasshopper of the first, on a chief gules, a lion passant guardant
  or, charged on the side with the letter G sable. Crest: on a wreath
  "silver and sables," an owl argent, legs, beak, and ears or. Mantling
  gules and argent.</p>

  <p>The following insignia of office I quote subject to the reservation
  that I am doubtful how far they enjoy official sanction:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The Lord Chancellor of England</i>: Two maces in saltire (or one in
  pale) behind the shield and the purse containing the Great Seal below
  it.</p>

  <p><i>The Lord Great Chamberlain of England</i>: Two golden keys in
  saltire; and</p>

  <p><i>The Lord Chamberlain of the Household</i>: A golden key in pale
  behind the shield.</p>

  <p>At Exeter the Dean, Precentor, Chancellor, and Treasurer have used
  official arms impaled with their own insignia. These were:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The Dean</i>: Azure, a stag's head caboshed and between the horns a
  cross patée fitchée argent.</p>

  <p><i>The Precentor</i>: Argent, on a saltire azure a fleur-de-lis
  or.</p>

  <p><i>The Chancellor</i>: Gules, a saltire argent between four crosslets
  or.</p>

  <p><i>The Treasurer</i>: Gules, a saltire between four leopards' heads
  or.</p>

  <p>The Dean of the Chapel Royal, Savoy, may perhaps employ the
  complicated coat of the chapel to impale his personal arms, placing the
  escutcheon on the breast of an eagle sable, crowned or.</p>

  <p>Many English Deaneries claim to possess arms which presumably the
  occupant may use to impale his own coat with, after the example of the
  Dean of Exeter. Such are London, Winchester, Lincoln, Salisbury,
  Lichfield, Durham, which all difference the arms of the see with a letter
  D of gold or sable.</p>

  <p>St. David's reverses the tinctures of the arms of the see.</p>

  <p>Norwich and Carlisle carry: Argent, a cross sable.</p>

  <p>Canterbury: Azure, on a cross argent the monogram <img
  src="images/cant.png" class="middle" style="height:3ex;" alt="XI monogram"
  /> sable.</p>

  <p>York differences the arms of the see by changing the crown into a
  mitre, and adding three plates in flanks and base. <!-- Page 589 --><span

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXVII</h5>

<h5>AUGMENTATIONS OF HONOUR</h5>

  <p>Of all heraldic distinctions the possession of an augmentation of
  honour is the one most prized. The Sovereign is of course the fountain of
  honour, and though ordinary grants of arms are made by Letters Patent
  under the hands and seals of the Kings of Arms, by virtue of the powers
  expressly and specifically conferred upon them in the Letters Patent
  respectively appointing them to their offices, a grant of arms is
  theoretically a grant from the Crown. The privilege of the possession of
  arms in the ordinary event is left in the discretion of the Earl Marshal,
  whose warrant is a condition precedent to the issue of a Grant. Providing
  a person is palpably living in that style and condition of life in which
  the use of arms is usual, subject always to the Earl Marshal's pleasure
  and discretion, a Grant of Arms can ordinarily be obtained upon payment
  of the usual fees. The social status of present-day grantees of arms is
  considerably in advance of the status of grantees in the Tudor period. An
  augmentation of arms, however, is on a totally and entirely different
  footing. It is an especial mark of favour from the Sovereign, and the
  effective grant is a Royal Warrant under the hand and Privy Seal of the
  Sovereign. The warrant recites and requires that the augmentation granted
  shall be exemplified and recorded in the College of Arms. Augmentations
  have been less frequently conferred in recent years than was formerly the
  case. Technically speaking, a gift of arms by the Sovereign direct where
  none previously existed is not an augmentation, though one is naturally
  inclined to include such grants in the category. Such an example is met
  with in the shield granted to Colonel Carlos by King Charles to
  commemorate their mutual adventures in the oak tree ("Or, issuing from a
  mount in base vert, an oak tree proper, over all on a fess gules, three
  Imperial crowns also proper") (Plate II.).</p>

  <p>There are many gorgeous legends relating to augmentations and arms
  which are said to have been granted by William the Conqueror as rewards
  after the Battle of Hastings. Personally I do not believe in a single
  one. There was a certain augmentation borne by the Dodge family, which,
  if it be correct, dates from the thirty-fourth year of Edward I., but
  whether this be authentic it is impossible to say. Most <!-- Page 590
  --><span class="pagenum" title="650.png"><a
  name="page590"></a>{590}</span>people consider the alleged <i>deed of
  grant</i> a forgery, and if this be so, the arms only exist by right of
  subsequent record and the question of augmentation rests upon tradition.
  The curious charge of the woman's breast distilling drops of milk to
  typify the nourishment afforded to the king's army is at any rate most
  interesting (Plate VI.). The earliest undoubted one in this country that
  I am aware of dates from the reign of Edward III. Sir John de Pelham
  shared in the glory of the Battle of Poictiers, and in the capture of the
  French King John. To commemorate this he was granted two round buckles
  with thongs. The Pelham family arms were "Azure, three pelicans argent,"
  and, as will be seen, these family arms were quartered with the buckles
  and thongs on a field gules as an augmentation. The quarterly coat forms
  a part of the arms both of Lord Chichester and of Lord Yarborough at the
  present day, and "the Pelham buckle" has been the badge of the Pelham
  family for centuries.</p>

  <p>Piers Legh fought with the Black Prince and took the Count de
  Tanquervil prisoner at the Battle of Crecy, "and did valiantly rere and
  advance the said princes Banner att the bataile of Cressy to the noe
  little encouragement of the English army," but it was not until the reign
  of Queen Elizabeth that the augmentation to commemorate this was
  granted.</p>

  <p>The Battle of Flodden was won by the Earl of Surrey, afterwards the
  Duke of Norfolk, and amongst the many rewards which the King showered
  upon his successful Marshal was the augmentation to his arms of "a
  demi-lion pierced in the mouth with an arrow, depicted on the colours for
  the arms of the Kingdom of Scotland, which the said James, late King of
  Scots, bore." According to the Act of Parliament under which it was
  granted this augmentation would seem now to belong exclusively to Lord
  Mowbray and Stourton and Hon. Mary Petre, but it is borne apparently with
  official sanction, or more likely perhaps by official inadvertence, by
  the Duke of Norfolk and the rest of the Howard family.</p>

  <p>The Battle of Agincourt is referred to by Shakespeare, who puts these
  words into King Henry's mouth on the eve of that great battle (Act iv.
  sc. 3):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers</p>
      <p>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</p>
      <p>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,</p>
      <p>This day shall gentle his condition."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is actual foundation in fact for these lines. For in a writ
  couched in very stringent and severe terms issued by the same king in
  after years decreeing penalties for the improper assumption and use of
  false arms, specific exception is made in favour of those "who bore <!--
  Page 591 --><span class="pagenum" title="651.png"><a
  name="page591"></a>{591}</span>arms with us at the Battle of Agincourt."
  Evidently this formed a very extensive kind of augmentation.</p>

  <p>The reign of Queen Elizabeth furnishes an interesting example of the
  gift of a complete coat in the case of Sir Francis Drake, who had been
  using the arms of another family of the same name. The representative of
  that family complained to the Queen that Sir Francis, whom he styled an
  upstart, should take such liberties with his arms; whereupon the Queen
  said she would give Sir Francis arms which should outrival those of his
  namesake. At least, such is the legend, and though the arms themselves
  were granted by Clarenceux King of Arms, and I have not yet found any
  Royal Warrant indicating that the grant was made by specific Royal
  command, it is possible the story is correct. The arms are: "Sable, a
  fess wavy between two stars argent. Crest: a ship under reef, drawn round
  a terrestrial globe with a cable by a hand issuing from clouds all
  proper" (Plate VI.). The stars upon the shield are the two pole stars,
  and the wavy band between them typifies Drake's voyage round the world,
  as does also the peculiar crest in which the Divine hand is shown guiding
  his ship around the globe.</p>

  <p>At the Battle of Naseby Dr. Edward Lake fought bravely for the King,
  and in the service of his Majesty received no less than sixteen wounds.
  At the end of the battle, when his left arm was useless, he put the
  bridle of his horse between his teeth and still fought on. The quartering
  of augmentation given to him was: "Gules, a dexter arm embowed in armour
  holding in the hand a sword erect all proper, thereto affixed a banner
  argent charged with a cross between sixteen escutcheons of the field, on
  the cross a lion of England." The sixteen shields upon the banner typify
  his sixteen wounds.</p>

  <p>After the Commonwealth was established in England, Charles II. made a
  desperate effort to regain his crown, an effort which culminated in his
  disastrous defeat at the Battle of Worcester. The King escaped through
  the gate of the city solely through the heroic efforts of Colonel Newman,
  and this is kept in remembrance by the inescutcheon of augmentation,
  viz.: "Gules, a portcullis imperially crowned or." Every one has heard
  how the King was accompanied in his wanderings by Colonel Carlos, who hid
  with him in the oak tree at Boscobel. Afterwards the king accompanied
  Mistress Jane Lane on horseback as her servant to the coast, whence he
  fled to the Continent. The reward of Colonel Carlos was the gift of the
  entire coat of arms already referred to. The Lanes, though not until
  after some years had passed and the King had come back to his own again,
  were granted two remarkable additions to their family arms. First of all
  "the canton of England" (that is, the arms of England upon a canton) was
  added <!-- Page 592 --><span class="pagenum" title="652.png"><a
  name="page592"></a>{592}</span>to their shield. They are the <i>only</i>
  family to whom such an honour has been given, and a most curious result
  has happened. When the use of armorial bearings was taxed by Act of
  Parliament the Royal Arms were specially exempted, and on account of this
  canton the Lane family claimed and obtained exemption from the tax. A few
  years later a crest was granted to them, namely, a strawberry-roan horse,
  "couped at the flanks," holding in its feet the Royal crown (Plate II.).
  It was upon a horse of this colour that the King and Mistress Lane had
  escaped and thereby saved the crown. Mr. Francis Wolfe, of Madeley, who
  also was a party to the escape, received the grant of an inescutcheon
  gules charged with a lion of England. Another family which bears an
  augmentation to commemorate King Charles' escape is Whitgreave.</p>

  <p>The reign of Queen Anne produced in the Duke of Marlborough one of the
  finest generals the world has ever seen; and in the Battle of Blenheim
  one of its greatest victories. The augmentation which commemorates this
  is a shield bearing the cross of St. George and in the centre a smaller
  shield with the golden lilies of France.</p>

  <p>In the year 1797 the Battle of Camperdown was fought, when Admiral
  Duncan defeated the Dutch Fleet and was created Lord Camperdown. To his
  family arms were added a naval crown and a representation of the gold
  medal given by George III. to Lord Camperdown to commemorate his
  victory.</p>

  <p>The arms of Nelson are most interesting, inasmuch as one version of
  the arms carries two separate and distinct augmentations. It is not,
  however, the coat as it was granted to and borne by the great Admiral
  himself. After the Battle of the Nile he received the augmentation on the
  chief, a landscape showing the palm-tree, the disabled ship, and the
  battery in ruins. The one crest was the plume of triumph given to the
  Admiral by the Sultan Selim III., and his second crest, which, however,
  is not a crest of augmentation, was the stern of the Spanish ship <i>San
  Josef.</i> After his death at the Battle of Trafalgar his brother was
  created Earl Nelson, and a second augmentation, namely, a fess wavy sable
  with the word "Trafalgar" upon it in gold letters, was added to the arms.
  This, however, has since been discontinued, except by Lord Bridport, who
  quarters it, whilst the Nelson family has reverted to the arms as they
  were borne by the great Admiral.</p>

  <p>After the death of Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar, Lord Collingwood
  took command, and though naval experts think that the action of
  Collingwood greatly minimised the number of prizes which would have
  resulted from the victory, Lord Collingwood received for an augmentation
  a chief wavy gules, thereon the lion of England, navally <!-- Page 593
  --><span class="pagenum" title="653.png"><a
  name="page593"></a>{593}</span>crowned, with the word "Trafalgar" above
  the lion. He also received an additional crest, namely, the stern of his
  ship, the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, between a wreath of oak on the one side
  and a wreath of laurel on the other.</p>

  <p>The heroic story of the famous fight between the <i>Shannon</i> and
  the <i>Chesapeake</i> has been often told. Captain Broke sent in a
  challenge to the <i>Chesapeake</i> to come out and fight him, and, though
  a banquet was prepared by the Mayor of Boston for that evening "to meet
  the English officers," Captain Broke defeated the <i>Chesapeake</i> in an
  engagement which only lasted a very short time. He was granted an
  additional crest, namely, an arm holding a trident and issuing from a
  naval crown, together with the motto, "Sævumque tridentem servamus."</p>

  <p>General Ross fought and won the Battle of Bladensburg, and took the
  city of Washington, dying a few days afterwards. The story is that the
  family were offered their choice of a baronetcy or an augmentation, and
  they chose the latter. The augmentation (Plate II.), which was specially
  granted with permission for it to be placed upon the monument to the
  memory of General Ross, consists of the arm holding the flag of the
  United States with a broken flag-staff which will be seen both on the
  shield itself, and as an additional crest. The shield also shows the gold
  cross for previous services at Corunna and in the Peninsula. The family
  were also given the surname of "Ross-of-Bladensburg."</p>

  <p>The capture of Curaçoa by Admiral Sir Charles Brisbane, K.C.B., is
  commemorated by the representation of his ship passing between the two
  Dutch forts; and by the additional crest of an arm in a naval officer's
  uniform grasping a cutlass. Admiral Sir Robert Otway, for his
  distinguished services, was granted: "On a chief azure an anchor between
  two branches of oak or, and on the dexter side a demi-Neptune and on the
  sinister a mermaid proper," to add to his shield. Admiral Sir George
  Pocock, who captured Havannah, was given for an augmentation: "On a chief
  wavy azure a sea-horse" (to typify his naval career), between two Eastern
  crowns (to typify his services in the East Indies), with the word
  "Havanna," the scene of his greatest victory.</p>

  <p>Sir Edward Pellew, who was created Viscount Exmouth for bombarding and
  destroying the fort and arsenal of Algiers, was given upon a chief a
  representation of that fort, with an English man-of-war in front of it,
  to add to his arms. It is interesting to note that one of his supporters,
  though not a part of his augmentation, represents a Christian slave, in
  memory of those in captivity at Algiers when he captured the city.</p>

  <p>There were several augmentations won at the Battle of Waterloo, <!--
  Page 594 --><span class="pagenum" title="654.png"><a
  name="page594"></a>{594}</span>and the Waterloo medal figures upon many
  coats of arms of Waterloo officers. Colonel Alexander Clark-Kennedy, with
  his own hand, captured the French Eagle of the 105th French Regiment. For
  this he bears a representation of it and a sword crossed upon a chief
  over his arms, and his crest of augmentation is a demi-dragoon holding
  the same flag. Of the multitude of honours which were showered upon the
  Duke of Wellington, not the least was his augmentation. This was a
  smaller shield to be superimposed upon his own, and charged with those
  crosses of St. George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick, which we term "the
  Union Jack." Sir Edward Kerrison, who distinguished himself so greatly in
  the Peninsula and at Waterloo, was granted a sword with a wreath of
  laurel and representations of his medals for Orthes and Waterloo, and,
  for an additional crest, an arm in armour holding a banner inscribed
  "Peninsula."</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas Munro, who will be long remembered as the Governor of
  Madras, was rewarded for his capture of Badamy by a representation of
  that hill-fort in India. The augmentation of Lord Keane is very similar,
  being a representation of the Fortress of Ghuznee in Afghanistan, which
  he captured. Other instances of a similar character are to be found in
  the arms of Cockburn-Campbell and Hamilton-Grace.</p>

  <p>The arms of Lord Gough are most remarkable, inasmuch as they show no
  less than two distinct and different augmentations both earned by the
  same man. In 1816, for his services in the Peninsula, he received a
  representation of the Spanish Order of Charles III., and on a chief the
  representation of the Fortress of Tarifa, with the crest of the arm
  holding the colours of his own regiment, the 87th, and a French eagle
  reversed and depressed. After his victories in the East, particularly at
  Goojerat, and for the subjugation and annexation of the Punjab, he was
  granted, in 1843, an additional quartering to add to his shield. This has
  the Lion of England holding up the Union Jack below the words "China" and
  "India." The third crest, which was then granted to him, shows a similar
  lion holding the Union Jack and a Chinese flag.</p>

  <p>Sir George Pollock, "of the Khyber Pass," Bart., earned everlasting
  fame for himself in the first Afghan War, by forcing the Khyber Pass and
  by the capture of Cabul. For this he was given an Eastern crown and the
  word "Khyber" on a chief as well as three cannon upon a canton, and at
  the same time he was granted an additional crest&mdash;a lion holding an
  Afghan banner with the staff thereof broken. With him it seemed as if the
  practice of granting augmentations for military services had ceased. Lord
  Roberts has none, neither has Lord Wolseley. But recently the old
  practice was reverted to in favour of Lord Kitchener. His family arms
  were: "Azure, a chevron cottised <!-- Page 595 --><span class="pagenum" title="655.png"
  ><a name="page595"></a>{595}</span>between three bustards," and in the
  centre chief point a bezant; with a stag's head for a crest; but for
  "smashing the Khalifa" he has been given the Union Jack and the Egyptian
  flag with the staves encircled by a coronet bearing the word "Khartoum,"
  all on a pile superimposed over his family arms. He also received a
  second crest of an elephant's head holding a sword in its trunk issuing
  from a mural crown. At the conclusion of the South African War a second
  augmentation was granted to him, this taking the form of a chief.</p>

  <p>Two other very interesting instances of augmentation of arms are
  worthy of mention.</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph Abercromby, after a distinguished career, fought and won the
  Battle of Aboukir Bay, only to die a few days later on board H.M.S.
  <i>Foudroyant</i> of his wounds received in the battle. But long before
  he had fought and conquered the French at Valenciennes, and in 1795 had
  been made a Knight of the Bath. The arms which are upon his Stall plate
  in Westminster Abbey include his augmentation, which is an arm in armour
  encircled by a wreath of laurel supporting the French Standard.</p>

  <p>Sir William Hoste gained the celebrated victory over the French fleet
  off the Island of Lissa in 1811, and the augmentation which was granted
  was a representation of his gold medal hanging from a naval crown, and an
  additional crest, an arm holding a flag inscribed with the word
  "Cattaro," the scene of another of his victories.</p>

  <p>Peace has its victories no less than war, but there is generally very
  much less fuss made about them. Consequently, the augmentations to
  commemorate entirely pacific actions are considerably fewer in number.
  The Speke augmentation has been elsewhere referred to, and reference may
  be made to the Ross augmentation to commemorate the Arctic exploits of
  Sir John Ross.</p>

  <p>It is a very common idea that arms were formerly to be obtained by
  conquest in battle. Like many other heraldic ideas, there is a certain
  amount of truth in the idea, from which very erroneous generalisations
  have been made. The old legend as to the acquisition of the plume of
  ostrich feathers by the Black Prince no doubt largely accounts for the
  idea. That legend, as has been already shown, lacks foundation.
  Territorial or sovereign arms doubtless would be subject to conquest, but
  I do not believe that because in battle or in a tournament <i>à
  outrance</i> one person defeated another, he therefore became entitled to
  assume, of his own motion, the arms of the man he had vanquished. The
  proposition is too absurd. But there is no doubt that in some number of
  historic cases his Sovereign has subsequently conferred upon the victor
  an augmentation which has closely approximated to the arms of his victim.
  Such cases occur in the arms of the Clerkes, Barts., <!-- Page 596
  --><span class="pagenum" title="656.png"><a
  name="page596"></a>{596}</span>of Hitcham, Bucks, who bear: "On a
  sinister canton azure, a demi-ram salient of the first, and in chief two
  fleurs-de-lis or, debruised by a baton," to commemorate the action of Sir
  John Clerke of Weston, who captured Louis D'Orleans, Duke of Longueville,
  at Borny, near Terouenne, 5 Henry VII. The augmentation conferred upon
  the Duke of Norfolk at the battle of Flodden has been already referred
  to, but the family of Lloyd of Stockton, co. Salop, carry a remarkable
  augmentation, inasmuch as they are permitted to bear the arms of Sir John
  Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, to commemorate his recapture by their ancestor
  after Lord Cobham's escape from the Tower.</p>

    of Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland and Earl of Oxford: Quarterly, 1 and

    and 3, quarterly gules and or, in the first quarter a mullet
    argent.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Augmentations which have no other basis than mere favour of kings, or
  consanguinity to the Royal Family, are not uncommon. Richard II., who
  himself adopted the arms of St. Edward the Confessor, bestowed the right
  to bear them also upon Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk (Fig. 675). No
  difference was added to them in his case, which is the more remarkable as
  they were borne by the Duke impaled with the arms of England. In 1397 the
  King conferred the same arms upon John de Holland, Duke of Exeter,
  differenced by a label argent, and upon Thomas de Holland, Duke of
  Surrey, within a bordure ermine. Richard II. seems to have been inclined
  to the granting of augmentations, for in 1386, when he created the Earl
  of Oxford (Robert de Vere) Duke of Ireland, he granted him as an
  augmentation the arms of Ireland ("Azure, three crowns or") within a
  bordure argent (Fig. 773). The Manners family, who were of Royal descent,
  but who, not being descended from an heiress, had no right to quarter the
  Royal Arms, received the grant of a chief "quarterly azure and gules, in
  the first and fourth quarters two fleurs-de-lis, and in the second and
  third a lion passant guardant or." This precedent might well be followed
  at the present day in the case of the daughters of the Duke and Duchess
  of Fife. It was adopted in the case of Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain.
  The Waller family, of Groombridge, co. Kent, one of whom, Richard Waller,
  captured Charles, Duke of Orleans, at the battle of Agincourt, received
  as an augmentation the right to suspend from the crest ("On a mount a
  walnut-tree proper") an escutcheon of the arms of that Prince, viz.:
  "Azure, three fleurs-de-lis or, a label of three points argent." Lord
  Polwarth bears one of the few augmentations granted by William III.,
  viz.: "An inescutcheon azure charged with an orange ensigned with an
  Imperial crown <!-- Page 597 --><span class="pagenum" title="657.png"><a
  name="page597"></a>{597}</span>all proper," whilst the titular King James
  III. and VIII. granted to John Græme, Earl of Alford, a coat of
  augmentation, viz.: "The Royal Arms of Scotland on the field and cross of
  St. Andrew counterchanged," the date of the grant being 20th January
  1734. Sir John Keith, Earl of Kintore, Knight Marischal of Scotland,
  saved the regalia of Scotland from falling into the hands of Cromwell,
  and in return the Keith arms (now quartered by Lord Kintore) were
  augmented with "an inescutcheon gules, a sword in bend sinister
  surmounted by a sceptre in bend dexter, in chief an Imperial crown, the
  whole within an orle of eight thistles."</p>

  <p>The well-known augmentation of the Seymour family: "Or, on a pile
  gules, between six fleurs-de-lis azure," is borne to commemorate the
  marriage of Jane Seymour to Henry VIII., who granted augmentations to all
  his wives except Catharine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves. The Seymour
  family is, however, the only one in which the use of the augmentation has
  been continued. The same practice was followed by granting the arms of
  England to the Consort of the Princess Caroline and to the late Prince
  Consort. See page <a href="#page499">499</a>.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:23%;">

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig.
    774.</span>&mdash;Device from the chief of the "Prussian Sword
    Nobility."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The frequent grant of the Royal tressure in Scotland, probably usually
  as an augmentation, has been already referred to. King Charles I. granted
  to the Earl of Kinnoull as a quartering of augmentation: "Azure, a
  unicorn salient argent, armed, maned, and unguled or, within a bordure of
  the last charged with thistles of Scotland and roses gules of England
  dimidiated." The well-known augmentation of the Medicis family, viz.: "A
  roundle azure, charged with three fleurs-de-lis or," was granted by Louis
  XII. to Pietro de Medicis. The Prussian Officers, ennobled on the 18th of
  January 1896, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of the new
  German Empire, bear as a device a chief purpure, and thereupon the
  Prussian sceptre and a sword in saltire interlaced by two oak-branches
  vert (Fig. 774). The late Right Hon. Sir Thomas Thornton, G.C.B.,
  received a Royal Licence to accept the Portuguese title of Conde de
  Cassilhas and an augmentation. This was an inescutcheon (ensigned by his
  coronet as a Conde) "or, thereon an arm embowed vested azure, the cuff
  gold, the hand supporting a flagstaff therefrom flowing the Royal
  Standard of Portugal." The same device issuing from his coronet was also
  granted to him as a crest of augmentation. Sir Woodbine Parish, K.C.H.,
  by legislative act of the Argentine Republic received in 1839 a grant of
  <!-- Page 598 --><span class="pagenum" title="658.png"><a
  name="page598"></a>{598}</span>the arms of that country, which was
  subsequently incorporated in the arms granted to him and registered in
  the Heralds' College in this country. He had been Consul-General and
  Chargé d'Affaires at Buenos Ayres, 1823-1832; he was appointed in 1824
  Plenipotentiary, and concluded the first treaty by which the Argentine
  Republic was formally recognised. Reference has been already made (page
  <a href="#page420">420</a>) to the frequent grant of supporters as
  augmentations, and perhaps mention should also be made of the
  inescutcheons for the Dukedom of Aubigny, borne by the Duke of Richmond
  and Gordon, and for the Duchy of Chatelherault, borne by the Duke of
  Abercorn. Possibly these should more properly be ranked as territorial
  arms and not as augmentations. A similar coat is the inescutcheon borne
  by the Earl of Mar and Kellie for his Earldom of Kellie. This, however,
  is stated by Woodward to be an augmentation granted by James VI. to Sir
  Thomas Erskine, one of several granted by that King to commemorate the
  frustration of the Gowrie Plot in 1600.</p>

  <p>The Marquess of Westminster, for some utterly inexplicable reason, was
  granted as an augmentation the right to bear the arms of the city of
  Westminster in the first quarter of his arms. Those who have rendered
  very great personal service to the Crown have been sometimes so favoured.
  The Halford and Gull (see page <a href="#page250">250</a>) augmentations
  commemorate medical services to the Royal Family, and augmentations have
  been conferred upon Sir Frederick Treves and Sir Francis Laking in
  connection with His Majesty's illness at the time of the Coronation.</p>

  <p>The badges of Ulster and Nova Scotia borne as such upon their shields
  by Baronets are, of course, augmentations.</p>

  <p>Two cases are known of augmentations to the arms of towns. The arms of
  Derry were augmented by the arms of the city of London in chief, when,
  after its fearful siege, the name of Derry was changed to Londonderry to
  commemorate the help given by the city of London. The arms of the city of
  Hereford had an azure bordure semé of saltires couped argent added to its
  arms after it had successfully withstood its Scottish siege, and this, by
  the way, is a striking example of colour upon colour, the field of the
  coat being gules.</p>

  <p>There are many grants in the later part of the eighteenth and the
  beginning of the nineteenth centuries recorded in Lyon Register which at
  first sight appear to be augmentations. Perhaps they are rightly so
  termed, but as the additions usually appear to be granted by the Lyon
  without specific Royal Warrants, they are hardly equivalent to the
  English ones issued during the same period. Many ordinary grants made in
  England which have borne direct reference to particular achievements of
  the grantee have been (by the grantees and their <!-- Page 599 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="659.png"><a
  name="page599"></a>{599}</span>descendants) wrongly termed augmentations.
  A rough and ready (though not a certain) test is to imagine the coat if
  the augmentation be removed, and see whether it remains a properly
  balanced design. Few of such coats will survive the test. The additions
  made to a coat to make it a different design, when a new grant is founded
  upon arms improperly used theretofore, are not augmentations, although
  spoken departures from the truth on this detail are by no means rare.

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h5>

<h5>ECCLESIASTICAL HERALDRY</h5>

  <p>Ecclesiastical heraldry has nothing like the importance in British
  armory that it possesses elsewhere. It may be said to consist in this
  country exclusively of the official arms assigned to and recorded for the
  archiepiscopal and episcopal sees, and the mitres and crosiers which are
  added to the shields, and a certain number of ecclesiastical symbols
  which occur as charges. In Pre-Reformation days there were, of course,
  the many religious houses which used armorial emblems, but with the
  suppression of the monasteries these vanished. The cardinal's hat was
  recognised in former days, and would still be officially certified in
  England as admittedly correctly displayed above the arms of a Roman
  cardinal. But the curious and intricate development of other varieties of
  the ecclesiastical hat which will be found in use in all other European
  countries is not known to British armory. Nor has the English College of
  Arms recognised the impersonal arms of the Catholic communities. Those
  arms, with and without the ecclesiastical hats, play a conspicuous part
  in Continental heraldry.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to assign a proper value or a definite status to the
  arms of the abbeys and other religious houses in this country in
  Pre-Reformation times. The principal, in fact the only important sources
  of information concerning them are the impressions of seals which have
  come down to us. Many of these seals show the effigies of saints or
  patrons, some show the impersonal arms of the religious order to whose
  rule the community conformed, some the personal arms of the official of
  the moment, others the personal arms of the founder. In other cases arms
  presumably those of the particular foundation or community occur, but in
  such cases the variations in design are so marked, and so often we find
  that two, three, or more devices are used indifferently and
  indiscriminately, that one is forced to arrive at the conclusion that a
  large proportion of the devices in use, though armorial in character, had
  no greater status than a temporary existence as seal designs. They
  distinctly lack the unchanging continuity one associates with armorial
  bearings. But whatever their status may <!-- Page 601 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="661.png"><a name="page601"></a>{601}</span>once
  have been, they have now completely passed out of being and may well be
  allowed to rest in the uncertainty which exists concerning them. The
  interest attaching to them can never be more than academic in character
  and limited in extent. The larger abbeys, the abbots of which were
  anciently summoned to Parliament as Lords of Parliament, appear to have
  adhered rather more consistently to a fixed device in each case, though
  the variations of design are very noticeable even in these instances. A
  list of them will be found in the <i>Genealogical Magazine</i> (vol. ii.
  p. 3).</p>

  <p>The suppression of the monasteries in this country was so thorough and
  so ruthless, that the contemporary instances of abbatical arms remaining
  to us from which deduction as to armorial rules and precedents can be
  made are singularly few in number, but it would appear that the abbot
  impaled the arms of his abbey on the dexter side of his personal arms,
  and placed his mitre above the shield.</p>

  <p>The mitre of an abbot differed from that of a bishop, inasmuch as it
  had no labels&mdash;or <i>infulæ</i>&mdash;depending from within it. The
  Abbot used a crosier, which doubtless was correctly added to his armorial
  bearings, but it is found in pale behind the shield, in bend, and also
  two in saltire, and it is difficult to assert which was the most correct
  form.</p>

  <p>The crosier of an abbot was also represented with the crook at its
  head curved inwards, the terminal point of the crook being entirely
  contained within the hook. The point of a bishop's, on the other hand,
  was turned outwards at the bottom of the crook. The difference is said to
  typify the distinction between the confined jurisdiction of the
  abbot&mdash;which was limited to the abbey and the community under his
  charge&mdash;and the more open and wider jurisdiction of the bishop.
  Although this distinction has been much disputed as regards its
  recognition for the actual crosiers employed, there can be no doubt that
  it is very generally adhered to in heraldic representations, though one
  hesitates to assert it as an absolute rule. The official arms for the
  archiepiscopal and episcopal sees are of some interest. With the single
  exception of York, the archiepiscopal coats of arms all have, in some
  form or another, the pallium which forms part of an archbishop's
  vestments or insignia of rank, but it is now very generally recognised
  and conceded that the pallium is not merely a charge in the official coat
  for any specified jurisdiction, but is itself the sign of the rank of an
  archbishop of the same character and status as is the mitre, the pallium
  being displayed upon a shield as a matter of convenience for artistic
  representation. This view of the case has been much strengthened by the
  discovery that in ancient instances of the archiepiscopal arms of York
  the pallium is found, and not the more modern coat of the crown and keys;
  but whether the pallium is <!-- Page 602 --><span class="pagenum" title="662.png"
  ><a name="page602"></a>{602}</span>to be still so considered, or whether
  under English armorial law it must now be merely ranked as a charge in an
  ordinary coat of arms, in general practice it is accepted as the latter;
  but it nevertheless remains a point of very considerable interest (which
  has not yet been elucidated) why the pallium should have been discarded
  for York, and another coat of arms substituted.</p>

  <p>The various coats used by the archbishops of England and Ireland are
  as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Canterbury.</i>&mdash;Azure, an episcopal staff in pale or, and
  ensigned with a cross patée argent surmounted of a pall of the last,
  charged with four crosses formée fitchée sable, edged and fringed or.</p>

  <p><i>York.</i>&mdash;Gules, two keys in saltire argent, in chief a Royal
  crown or.</p>

  <p><i>Armagh.</i>&mdash;Azure, an episcopal staff argent, ensigned with a
  cross patée or, surmounted by a pallium of the second, edged and fringed
  or, charged with four crosses formée fitchée sable.</p>

  <p><i>Dublin.</i>&mdash;The arms of this archbishopric are the same as
  those of Armagh, only with five crosses charged on the pallium instead of
  four.</p>

  <p>The arms of the episcopal sees have no attribute at all similar to the
  charge of the pallium in the coat of an archbishop, and are merely so
  many different coats of arms. The shield of every bishop and archbishop
  is surmounted by his mitre, and it is now customary to admit the use of
  the mitre by all persons holding the title of bishop who are recognised
  as bishops by the English law.</p>

  <p>This, of course, includes Colonial and Suffragan bishops, retired
  bishops, and bishops of the Episcopal Churches in Scotland and in
  Ireland. It is a moot point whether the bishops of the Episcopal Churches
  in Ireland and in Scotland are entitled to make use of the official arms
  formerly assigned to their sees at a period when those Churches were
  State-established; but, looking at the matter from a strictly official
  point of view, it would not appear that they are any longer entitled to
  make use of them.</p>

  <p>The mitres of an archbishop and of a bishop&mdash;in spite of many
  statements to the contrary&mdash;are exactly identical, and the mistaken
  idea which has of late years (the practice is really quite a modern one)
  encircled the rim of an archbishop's mitre with the circlet of a coronet
  is absolutely incorrect.</p>

  <p>There are several forms of mitre which, when looked upon as an
  ecclesiastical ornament, can be said to exist; but from the heraldic
  point of view only one mitre is recognised, and that is of gold, the
  labels being of the same colour. The jewelled variety is incorrect in
  armorial representations, though the science of armory does not appear to
  have enforced any particular <i>shape</i> of mitre.</p>

  <p>The "several forms" of the mitre&mdash;to which allusion has just been
  <!-- Page 603 --><span class="pagenum" title="663.png"><a
  name="page603"></a>{603}</span>made&mdash;refer to the use in actual
  practice which prevailed in Pre-Reformation England, and still holds
  amongst Roman Catholic bishops at the present day. These are three in
  number, <i>i.e.</i> the "precious" (<i>pretiosa</i>), the gold
  (<i>auriferata</i>), and the simple (<i>simplex</i>). The two former are
  both employed at a Pontifical Mass (being alternately assumed at
  different parts of the service); the second only is worn at such rites as
  Confirmation, &amp;c.; while the third (which is purely of white linen)
  is confined to Services for the Dead, and on Good Friday. As its name
  implies, the first of these is of cloth of gold, ornamented to a greater
  or less degree with jewels, while the second&mdash;though likewise of
  cloth of gold&mdash;is without any design or ornament. The short Gothic
  mitre of Norman days has now given place to the modern Roman one, an
  alteration which, with its great height and arched sides, can hardly
  perhaps be considered an artistic improvement. Some individual Roman
  Catholic bishops at the present day, however (in England at any rate),
  wear mitres more allied to the Norman and Gothic shape.</p>

  <p>The past fifteen or so years have seen a revival&mdash;though in a
  purely eclectic and unofficial manner&mdash;of the <i>wearing</i> of the
  mitre by Church of England bishops. Where this has been (and is being)
  done, the older form of mitre has been adhered to, though from the
  informal and unofficial nature of the revival no rules as to its use have
  been followed, but only individual choice.</p>

  <p>At the recent Coronation, mitres were <i>not</i> worn; which they
  undoubtedly would have been had this revival now alluded to been made
  authoritatively.</p>

  <p>All bishops and archbishops are entitled to place two crosiers in
  saltire behind their shields. Archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church
  have continuously placed in pale behind their shields what is known as
  the archbishop's cross. In actual practice, the cross carried before an
  archbishop is an ordinary one with one transverse piece, but the heraldic
  archiepiscopal cross is always represented as a double cross, <i>i.e.</i>
  having two transverse pieces one above the other. In the Established
  Church of England the archiepiscopal cross&mdash;as in the Roman Catholic
  Church&mdash;is the plain two-armed variety, and though the cross is
  never officially recognised as an armorial attribute and is not very
  frequently met with in heraldic representations, there can be no doubt
  that if this cross is used to typify archiepiscopal rank, it should be
  heraldically represented with the double arms. The actual cross borne
  before archbishops is termed the provincial cross, and it may be of
  interest to here state that the Bishops of Rochester are the official
  cross-bearers to the Archbishops of Canterbury.</p>

  <p>To the foregoing rules there is one notable exception, <i>i.e.</i> the
  Bishop <!-- Page 604 --><span class="pagenum" title="664.png"><a
  name="page604"></a>{604}</span>of Durham. The Bishopric of Durham, until
  the earlier part of the nineteenth century, was a Palatinate, and in
  earlier times the Bishops of Durham, who had their own parliament and
  Barons of the Palatinate, exercised a jurisdiction and regality, limited
  in extent certainly, but little short in fact or effect of the power of
  the Crown. If ever any ecclesiastic can be correctly said to have enjoyed
  temporal power, the Bishops of Durham can be so described. The
  Prince-Bishops of the Continent had no such attributes of regality vested
  in themselves as were enjoyed by the Bishops of Durham. These were in
  truth kings within their bishoprics, and even to the present
  day&mdash;though modern geographies and modern social legislation have
  divided the bishopric into other divisions&mdash;one still hears the term
  employed of "within" or "without" the bishopric.</p>

  <p>The result of this temporal power enjoyed by the Bishops of Durham is
  seen in their heraldic achievement. In place of the two crosiers in
  saltire behind the shield, as used by the other bishops, the Bishops of
  Durham place a sword and a crosier in saltire behind their shield to
  signify both their temporal and spiritual jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>The mitre of the Bishop of Durham is heraldically represented with the
  rim encircled by a ducal coronet, and it has thereby become usual to
  speak of the coronetted mitre of the Bishop of Durham; but it should be
  clearly borne in mind that the coronet formed no part of the actual
  mitre, and probably no mitre has ever existed in which the rim has been
  encircled by a coronet. But the Bishops of Durham, by virtue of their
  temporal status, used a coronet, and by virtue of their ecclesiastical
  status used a mitre, and the representation of both of these at one and
  the same time has resulted in the coronet being placed to encircle the
  rim of the mitre. The result has been that, heraldically, they are now
  always represented as one and the same article.</p>

  <p>It is, of course, from this coronetted mitre of Durham that the wholly
  inaccurate idea of the existence of coronet on the mitre of an archbishop
  has originated. Apparently the humility of these Princes of the Church
  has not been sufficient to prevent their appropriating the peculiar
  privileges of their ecclesiastical brother of lesser rank.</p>

  <p>A crest is never used with a mitre or ecclesiastical hat. Many writers
  deny the right of any ecclesiastic to a crest. Some deny the right also
  to use a motto, but this restriction has no general acceptance.</p>

  <p>Therefore ecclesiastical heraldry in Britain is summed up in (1) its
  recognition of the cardinal's hat, (2) the official coat of arms for
  ecclesiastical purposes, (3) the ensigns of ecclesiastical rank above
  alluded to, viz. mitre, cross, and crosier. <!-- Page 605 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="665.png"><a
  name="page605"></a>{605}</span>Ecclesiastical heraldry&mdash;notably in
  connection with the Roman Church&mdash;in other countries has, on the
  contrary, a very important place in armorial matters. In addition to the
  emblems officially recognised for English heraldry, the ecclesiastical
  hat is in constant use.</p>

  <p>The use of the ecclesiastical hat is very general outside Great
  Britain, and affords one of the few instances where the rules governing
  heraldic usages are identical throughout the Continent.</p>

  <p>This curious unanimity is the more remarkable because it was not until
  the seventeenth century that the rather intricate rules concerning the
  colours of the hats used for different ranks and the number of tassels
  came into vogue.</p>

  <p>Other than the occasional recognition of the cardinal's hat in former
  days, the only British official instance of the use of the ecclesiastical
  hat is met with in the case of the very recent matriculation of arms in
  Lyon Register to Right Rev. Æneas Chisholm, the present Roman Catholic
  Bishop of Aberdeen. I frankly admit I am unaware why the ecclesiastical
  hat assigned to the bishop in the official matriculation of his arms has
  ten tassels on either side. The Continental usage would assign him but
  six, and English armory has no rules of its own which can be quoted in
  opposition thereto. Save as an acceptance of Roman regulations (Roman
  Holy Orders, it should not be forgotten, are recognised by the English
  Common Law to the extent that a Roman Catholic priest is not reordained
  if he becomes an Anglican clergyman), the heraldic ecclesiastical hat of
  a bishop has no existence with us, and the Roman regulations would give
  him but six tassels.</p>

  <p>The mitre is to be met with as a charge and as a crest, for instance,
  in the case of Barclay and Berkeley ["A mitre gules, labelled and
  garnished or, charged with a chevron between ten crosses patée, six and
  four argent. Motto: 'Dieu avec nous'"]; and also in the case of Sir
  Edmund Hardinge, Bart., whose crests are curious ["1. of honourable
  augmentation, a hand fesswise couped above the wrist habited in naval
  uniform, holding a sword erect surmounting a Dutch and a French flag in
  saltire, on the former inscribed "Atalanta," on the latter
  "Piedmontaise," the blade of the sword passing through a wreath of laurel
  near the point and a little below through another of cypress, with the
  motto, 'Postera laude recens;' 2. a mitre gules charged with a chevron
  argent, fimbriated or, thereon three escallops sable."]</p>

  <p>The cross can hardly be termed exclusively ecclesiastical, but a
  curious figure of this nature is to be met with in the arms recently
  granted to the Borough of Southwark. It was undoubtedly taken from the
  device used in Southwark before its incorporation, though as there were
  many bodies who adopted it in that neighbourhood, it is difficult to
  assign it to a specific origin. <!-- Page 606 --><span class="pagenum" title="666.png"
  ><a name="page606"></a>{606}</span></p>

  <p>Pastoral staves and passion-nails are elsewhere referred to, and the
  figures of saints and ecclesiastics are mentioned in the chapter on "The
  Human Figure."</p>

  <p>The emblems of the saints, which appear to have received a certain
  amount of official recognition&mdash;both ecclesiastical and
  heraldic&mdash;supply the origin of many other charges not in themselves
  heraldic. An instance of this kind will be found in the sword of St.
  Paul, which figures on the shield of London. The cross of St. Cuthbert,
  which has been adopted in the unauthorised coat for the See of
  Newcastle-on-Tyne, and the keys of St. Peter, which figure in many
  ecclesiastical coats, are other examples. The lilies of the Virgin are,
  of course, constantly to be met with in the form of fleurs-de-lis and
  natural flowers; the Wheel of St. Catharine is familiar, and the list
  might be extended indefinitely. <!-- Page 607 --><span class="pagenum" title="667.png"

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XXXIX</h5>

<h5>ARMS OF DOMINION AND SOVEREIGNTY</h5>

  <p>Royal arms in many respects differ from ordinary armorial bearings,
  and it should be carefully borne in mind that they stand, not for any
  particular area of land, but for the intangible sovereignty vested in the
  rulers thereof. They are not necessarily, nor are they in fact,
  hereditary. They pass by conquest. A dynastic change which introduces new
  sovereignties introduces new quarterings, as when the Hanoverian dynasty
  came to the throne of this country the quartering of Hanover was
  introduced, but purely personal arms in British heraldry are never
  introduced. The personal arms of Tudor and Stewart were never added to
  the Royal Arms of this country.</p>

  <p>The origin of the English Royal Arms was dealt with on page <a
  href="#page172">172</a>. "Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale
  or," as the arms of England, were used by Kings John, Henry III., Edward
  I., and Edward II. The quartering for France was introduced by Edward
  III., as explained on page <a href="#page274">274</a>, and the Royal
  shield: Quarterly 1 and 4, France, ancient (azure, semé-de-lis or); 2 and
  3, England (gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or), was in use
  in the reigns of Edward III., Richard II. (who, however, impaled his arms
  with those of St. Edward the Confessor), and Henry IV. The last-mentioned
  king about 1411 reduced the number of fleurs-de-lis to <i>three</i>, and
  the shield remained without further change till the end of the reign of
  Edward VI. Queen Mary did not alter the arms of this country, but during
  the time of her marriage with Philip of Spain they were always borne
  impaled with the arms of Spain. Queen Elizabeth bore the same shield as
  her predecessors. But when James I. came to the throne the arms were:
  "Quarterly 1 and 4, quarterly i. and iiii. France, ii. and iii. England;
  2. Scotland (or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory and
  counterflory gules); 3. Ireland (azure, a harp or, stringed argent)." The
  shield was so borne by James I., Charles I., Charles II., and James
  II.</p>

  <p>When William III. and Mary came to the throne an inescutcheon of the
  arms of Nassau ("Azure, billetty and a lion rampant or") was <!-- Page
  608 --><span class="pagenum" title="668.png"><a
  name="page608"></a>{608}</span>superimposed upon the Royal Arms as
  previously borne, for William III., and he impaled the same coat without
  the inescutcheon for his wife. At her death the impalement was dropped.
  After the Union with Scotland in 1707 the arms of England ("Gules, three
  lions," &amp;c.) were <i>impaled</i> with those of Scotland (the tressure
  not being continued down the palar line), and the impaled coat of England
  and Scotland was placed in the first and fourth quarters, France in the
  second, Ireland in the third.</p>

  <p>At the accession of George I. the arms of Hanover were introduced in
  the fourth quarter. These were: "Tierced in pairle reversed, 1.
  Brunswick, gules, two lions passant guardant in pale or; 2. Luneberg, or,
  semé of hearts gules, a lion rampant azure; 3. (in point), Westphalia,
  gules, a horse courant argent, and on an inescutcheon (over the fourth
  quarter) gules, the crown of Charlemagne (as Arch Treasurer of the Holy
  Roman Empire)."</p>

  <p>At the union with Ireland in 1801 the opportunity was taken to revise
  the Royal Arms, and those of France were then discontinued. The
  escutcheon decided upon at that date was: "Quarterly, 1 and 4, England;
  2. Scotland; 3. Ireland and the arms of Hanover were placed upon an
  inescutcheon." This inescutcheon was surmounted by the Electoral cap, for
  which a crown was substituted later when Hanover became a kingdom.</p>

  <p>At the death of William IV., by the operation of the Salic Law, the
  crowns of England and Hanover were separated, and the inescutcheon of
  Hanover disappeared from the Royal Arms of this country, and by Royal
  Warrant issued at the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria the Royal
  Arms and badges were declared to be: 1 and 4, England; 2. Scotland; 3.
  Ireland. The necessary alteration of the cyphers are the only alterations
  made by his present Majesty.</p>

  <p>The supporters date from the accession of James I. Before that date
  there had been much variety. Some of the Royal badges have been already
  alluded to in the chapter on that subject.</p>

  <p>The differences used by various junior members of the Royal Family
  will be found in the Chapter on Marks of Cadency. <!-- Page 609 --><span

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XL</h5>

<h5>HATCHMENTS</h5>

  <p>A custom formerly prevailed in England, which at one time was of very
  considerable importance. This was the setting up of a hatchment after a
  death. No instances of hatchments of a very early date, as far as I am
  aware, are to be met with, and it is probably a correct conclusion that
  the custom, originating rather earlier, came into vogue in England during
  the seventeenth century and reached its height in the eighteenth. It
  doubtless originated in the carrying of ceremonial shields and helmets
  (afterwards left in the church) at funerals in the sixteenth century, and
  in the earlier practice of setting up in the church the actual shield of
  a deceased person. The cessation of the ceremonial funeral, no doubt, led
  to the cult of the hatchment. Hatchments cannot be said even yet to have
  come entirely to an end, but instances of their use are nowadays
  extremely rare, and since the early part of the nineteenth century the
  practice has been steadily declining, and at the present time it is
  seldom indeed that one sees a hatchment <i>in use</i>. The word
  "hatchment" is, of course, a corruption of the term "achievement," this
  being the heraldic term implying an emblazonment of the full armorial
  bearings of any person.</p>

  <p>The manner of use was as follows. Immediately upon the death of a
  person of any social position a hatchment of his or her arms was set up
  over the entrance to his house, which remained there for twelve months,
  during the period of mourning. It was then taken down from the house and
  removed to the church, where it was set up in perpetuity. There are few
  churches of any age in this country which do not boast one or more of
  these hatchments, and some are rich in their possession. Those now
  remaining&mdash;for example, in St. Chad's Church in
  Shrewsbury&mdash;must number, I imagine, over a hundred. There does not
  appear to have been any obligation upon a clergyman either to permit
  their erection, or to allow them to remain for any specified period. In
  some churches they have been discarded and relegated to the vestry, to
  the coal-house, or to the rubbish-heap, whilst in others they have been
  carefully preserved.</p>

  <p>The hatchment was a diamond-shaped frame, painted black, and <!-- Page
  610 --><span class="pagenum" title="670.png"><a
  name="page610"></a>{610}</span>enclosing a painting in oils upon wood, or
  more frequently canvas, of the full armorial bearings of the deceased
  person. The frame was usually about five feet six in height, and the
  rules for the display of arms upon hatchments afford an interesting set
  of regulations which may be applied to other heraldic emblazonments. The
  chief point, however, concerning a hatchment, and also the one in which
  it differs from an ordinary armorial emblazonment, lay in the colour of
  the groundwork upon which the armorial bearings were painted. For an
  unmarried person the whole of the groundwork was black, but for a husband
  or wife half was black and half white, the groundwork behind the arms of
  the deceased person being black, and of the surviving partner in
  matrimony white. The background for a widow or widower was entirely
  black. <!-- Page 611 --><span class="pagenum" title="671.png"><a

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XLI</h5>

<h5>THE UNION JACK</h5>

<h5 class="sm"><span class="sc">By Rev. J. R. CRAWFORD</span></h5>

  <p>Orders in Council and other official documents refer to this flag as
  the Union Flag, The Union Jack, Our Jack, The King's Colours, and the
  Union Banner, which last title precise Heraldry usually adopts. In
  patriotic songs it is toasted as "The Red, White, and Blue," whilst in
  the Services men affectionately allude to it as "the dear old duster."
  But Britons at large cling to the title which heads this chapter; to them
  it is "<i>The Union Jack</i>."</p>

  <p><i>Why Union?</i> Obviously because it unites three emblems of tutelar
  saints on one flag, and thereby denotes the union of three peoples under
  one Sovereign. It is the motto "<i>Tria juncta in Uno</i>" rendered in
  bunting.</p>

  <p><i>Why Jack?</i> Two theories are propounded, one fanciful, the other
  probable. Some say "Jack" is the anglicised form of "Jacques," which is
  the French signature of James I., in whose reign and by whose command the
  first Union Flag was called into being. Against this at least three
  reasons may justly be urged: (1) The term "<i>Jack</i>" does not
  appear&mdash;so far as we can discover&mdash;in any warrant referring to
  the Jacobean Flag of 1606. It is rather in later documents that this term
  occurs. (2) If the earliest Union Flag be a "<i>Jack</i>" just because it
  is the creation of James, then surely it follows that, to be consistent,
  later Union Flags, the creations of later sovereigns, should have borne
  those Sovereigns' names; for example <i>The Union Anne</i>, <i>The Union
  George</i>! (3) The English way of pronouncing "Jacques" is not, and
  probably never was <i>Jack</i>, but <i>Jaikes</i>. The other, and more
  feasible theory, is as follows: The term "Jaque" (e.g. <i>jaque de
  mailles</i>) was borrowed from the French and referred to any jacket or
  coat on which, especially, heraldic emblems were blazoned. In days long
  prior to those of the first Stuart king, mention is made of "<b>whytte
  cotes with red crosses worn by shyppesmen and men of the cette of
  London</b>," from which sentence we learn that the emblem of the nation's
  tutelar saint was (as in yet earlier Crusaders' days) a <i>fighter's</i>
  emblem. When such emblem or emblems were transferred to a flag, <!-- Page
  612 --><span class="pagenum" title="672.png"><a
  name="page612"></a>{612}</span>the term <i>Jaque</i> may well, in course
  of time, have been also applied to that flag, as previously to the
  jacket.</p>

  <p>Glance now at the story of those Orders in Council which created the
  various Union flags. The very union of the two kingdoms of England and
  Scotland seems to have accentuated the pettier national jealousies, so
  that Southrons annoyed Northerners by hoisting the St. George above the
  St. Andrew, and the Scotchmen retaliated by a species of <i>tu
  quoque</i>. The King sought to allay these quarrels by creating a
  British, as other than a purely English or Scottish, flag. But let the
  Proclamation speak for itself.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>By the King.</i></p>

  <p>"<i>Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of
  South and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their
  Flagges: For the avoiding of all contentions hereafter, Wee have, with
  the advice of our Councill, ordered: That from henceforth all our
  Subjects of this Isle and Kingdome of Great Britaine, and all our members
  thereof, shall beare in their main-toppe the Red Crosse, commonly called
  St. George's Crosse, and the White Crosse, commonly called St. Andrew's
  Crosse, joyned together according to the forme made by our heralds, and
  sent by Us to our Admerall to be published to our Subjects: and in their
  fore-toppe our Subjects of South Britaine shall weare the Red Crosse
  onely as they were wont, and our Subjects of North Britaine in their
  fore-toppe the White Crosse onely as they were
  accustomed.</i>"&mdash;1606.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This attempt at conciliating differences deserved but did not win
  success. "<i>The King's Owne Shipps</i>" deemed themselves slighted,
  since all vessels were treated alike in this matter, and so persistent
  was the agitation that at last, in Charles I.'s reign (1634), another
  Proclamation was issued "<i>for the honour of Oure Shipps in Oure Navie
  Royall</i>," whereby those ships alone had the right of hoisting "<i>the
  Union Flagge</i>." The days of the Commonwealth brought another change,
  for with the King the King's Flag disappeared. The Protector caused two
  new flags to be made, viz. <i>The Great Union</i> (a flag little used,
  however, although it figured at his funeral obsequies), and which may be
  thus blazoned: <i>Quarterly 1 and 4, The St. George</i>; 2. <i>The St.
  Andrew</i>; 3. <i>azure, a harp or, for Ireland; over all on an
  inescutcheon of pretence, sable, a lion rampant or</i>, for the
  Protector's personal arms, and <i>The Commonwealth Ensign</i>, which
  latter Parliament treated as the paramount flag. The most interesting
  features of this flag are that it was of three kinds, one red, one white,
  one blue, and that Ireland but not Scotland had a place on its folds.
  When the King came to <!-- Page 613 --><span class="pagenum" title="675.png"
  ><a name="page613"></a>{613}</span>his own again yet another change was
  witnessed. By this Proclamation ships in the Navy were to carry <i>The
  Union</i>, and all merchantmen <i>The St. George</i>, whilst these latter
  vessels were also to wear "<i>The Red Ensign with the St. George, on a
  Canton</i>." Passing on, we reach the days of Queen Anne, who as soon as
  the union of the two Parliaments was accomplished, issued a famous
  Proclamation often quoted. Suffice it here to outline its effect.</p>

  were&mdash;as the Treaty of Union had agreed should
  be&mdash;"<i>conjoyned in such a manner as we should think fit</i>"; and
  what that manner was is "<i>described on the margent</i>" in the shape of
  a sketch. But further, in place of the <i>St. George</i> being placed on
  the canton of the <i>Red Ensign</i> of Charles II. (itself the
  <i>Commonwealth Ensign, minus</i> the harp) the Proclamation ordered the
  "<i>Union</i>" as a canton, and finally this new Red Ensign was confined
  to the merchant ships, whilst "<i>Our Jack</i>" was reserved for the use
  of the Navy, unless by particular warrant. Thus things continued until
  the union of Ireland with England and Scotland. The Proclamation
  referring to this Act of Union closes with the Herald's verbal blazon of
  the full Union Flag:&mdash;"<i>The Union Flag shall be Azure, the Crosses
  Saltire of St. Andrew and St. Patrick, Quarterly per saltire,
  countercharged Argent and Gules, the latter fimbriated of the second,
  surmounted by the Cross of St. George of the third, fimbriated as the
  Saltire.</i>" Thus the Union, as displayed in bunting, was perfected.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Union Flag</i> is very remarkable, even amongst the flags of
  Christendom, both as a blending of crosses, and crosses only, and also as
  an emblem of the union of two or more countries. Yet it is not unique,
  for the flags of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have a somewhat similar
  story to tell. The last two countries separated at <!-- Page 614 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="676.png"><a
  name="page614"></a>{614}</span>different dates from Denmark, and then
  together formed a United Scandinavian Kingdom. In separating, they each
  took to themselves a separate flag, and again, in uniting, they called
  into being a Union Banner. How they treated these changes Fig. 775 will
  illustrate. Notwithstanding these acts of union both Scandinavians and
  Britons have had, and we still have, differences over these Union Flags.
  Whilst, however, they based their protests on the sentiment of
  independence, we ground our grumblings on questions of heraldic
  precedence, and of the interpretation of verbal blazons. Leaving our
  neighbours to settle their differences, let us examine our own. Take the
  subject of precedence. Very early in the flag's history, Scotsmen were
  indignant because the St. Andrew was not placed over the St. George. All
  kinds of variations have been suggested to lessen this crux of
  precedence, but such attempts must plainly be in vain. Do what you will,
  some kind of precedence is unavoidable. The <i>St. George</i>, then, as
  representing the paramount partner, occupies the centre of the flag,
  whilst the <i>St. Andrew</i>, as senior in partnership to the <i>St.
  Patrick</i>, is placed <i>above the St. Patrick, in the first
  quarter</i>, although throughout it is counterchanged. The words in
  italic are important, for when the order is reversed, then that
  particular flag is flying upside down.</p>

  <p>The mode of procedure in creating flags has been much the same from
  one reign to another. Briefly it is this: The Sovereign seeks the advice
  of, and receives a report from, the Lords of the Privy Council. These
  councillors are "<i>attended by the King of Arms and Heralds, with
  diverse drafts prepared by them</i>." A decision being arrived at, an
  Order in Council, followed by a Royal Proclamation, makes known the
  character of the flag. In both Order and Proclamation it is usual to make
  reference to the verbal blazon, and to "<i>the form made by our
  heralds</i>." Thus there are three agents recognised&mdash;(1) the
  Sovereign, the fountain of all honours; (2) the heralds, who
  authoritatively blazon, outline, and register all achievements; and (3)
  the naval authority, as that in which are vested the duty and the power
  of seeing the actual bunting properly made up and properly flown. <!--

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.
    777.</span>&mdash;The Union Flag of 1801.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In keeping with this, the general mode of procedure, the Proclamations
  demand our attention. The Proclamation of James (1606). A high official
  of the College of Arms informs us that neither verbal blazon nor drawing
  of the first Union Flag is extant. On the other hand, in the
  Proclamations of 1707 and 1801 we have both blazon and drawing. The
  blazon has already been given of the 1801 flag (which is the one most
  needing a verbal blazon), and the drawings of both flags we here produce
  (Figs. 776 and 777). These drawings&mdash;though slightly reduced in
  these pages&mdash;are most careful copies of the <i>signed</i> copies
  supplied to us by the official already alluded to. In forwarding them he
  writes: "<i>They are not drawn to scale</i>;" and he adds, further on,
  "<i>they are exactly the same size as recorded in our books</i>." So then
  we have, in these two drawings, the heralds' interpretation, <i>at the
  time</i>, of their own verbal blazon. Now comes the Admiralty part of the
  work. In the Admiralty Regulations we have a "<i>Memorandum relative to
  the origin of the Union Flag in its present form</i>." In this there is a
  brief history of the changes made in the flag from time to time, with
  quotations from the warrants, together with the verbal blazon <span
  class="sm">AND</span> two coloured drawings (Figs. 778 and 779). The
  Admiralty has also appended to the Memorandum the following interesting
  and ingeniously worked out <i>Table of Proportions, adapted for a flag 15
  feet by 7½ feet</i>. Presumably this table forms the basis upon which all
  Union Flags are made up under Admiralty supervision:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The student of heraldry will observe that this table is based on the
  proportions of the Ordinaries and Sub-Ordinaries figuring on the flag, as
  those proportions are regulated by English Rules of Armory. These rules
  give a cross as &#x2153;, a saltire as <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>, a fimbriation
  about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>, of
  <!-- Page 616 --><span class="pagenum" title="678.png"><a
  name="page616"></a>{616}</span>the flag's width. By the way, we notice
  here, yet only to dismiss it as hypercritical, the objection taken to the
  employment (in the verbal blazon of 1801) of the term
  "<i>fimbriated</i>." To our mind this objection seems a storm in a
  teacup. Further, it is always admissible in armory to lessen the size of
  charges when these crowd a field, and although we are fully aware that
  the laws of armory are not always nor all of them applied to flags, yet
  there is sufficient evidence to show that the heralds and the Admiralty
  did recognise the cases of shields and flags to be somewhat analogous.
  But there are two features in <i>The Admiralty pattern</i> which cannot
  but arrest the attention of all those who have made a study of armory.
  The one is that the sub-ordinaries, <i>i.e.</i> the fimbriations, have
  different proportions given to them, although they are repetitions of the
  same sub-ordinary, and also seem guarded against such treatment by the
  very wording of the blazon, and by the practice usual in such cases. And
  the other is that, after counterchanging the saltires, the St. Patrick is
  attenuated by having its fimbriation taken off its own field, instead (as
  the common custom is) off the field of the flag.</p>

  <p>All Warrants dealing with flags provide for their being flown <i>at
  sea</i> (Queen Anne's Proclamation is apparently the first that adds
  "<i>and land</i>"), and gradually reserve for the Royal Navy&mdash;or
  fighting ships&mdash;the honour of alone bearing the Union Jack. The
  accompanying diagram shows at a glance the changes made by the several
  Proclamations. The latest word on this subject is "The Merchant Shipping
  (Colours) Act of Queen Victoria, 1894." This Acts sets forth among other
  things that&mdash;(1) "<i>The red ensign usually worn by merchant ships,
  without any defacement or modification whatsoever, is hereby declared to
  be the proper national colours for all ships and boats belonging to any
  British subject, except in the case of Her Majesty's ships or boats, or
  in the case of any other ship or boat for the time being allowed to wear
  any other national colours in <!-- Page 617 --><span class="pagenum" title="679.png"
  ><a name="page617"></a>{617}</span>pursuance of a warrant from Her
  Majesty or from the Admiralty.</i> (2) <i>If any distinctive national
  colours except such red ensign, or except the Union Jack with a white
  border, or if any colours usually worn by Her Majesty's ships, &amp;c.
  ... are or is hoisted on board any ship ... without warrant ... for each
  offence ... a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds.</i>" <!-- Page 618

<h5 class="lg125">CHAPTER XLII</h5>

<h5>"SEIZE-QUARTIERS"</h5>

<h5><span class="sc">Proof of Ancestry</span></h5>

  <p>If any heraldic term has been misunderstood in this country,
  "Seize-Quartiers" is that term. One hears "Seize-Quartiers" claimed right
  and left, whereas in British armory it is only on the very rarest
  occasions that proof of it can be made. In England there is not, and
  never has been, for any purpose a real "test" of blood. By the statutes
  of various Orders of Knighthood, esquires of knights of those orders are
  required to show that their grandparents were of gentle birth and
  entitled to bear arms, and a popular belief exists that Knights of
  Justice of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in England
  need to establish some test of birth. The wording of the statute,
  however, is very loose and vague, and in fact, judging from the names and
  arms of some of the knights, must be pretty generally ignored. But Peer,
  K.G., or C.B., alike need pass no test of birth. The present state of
  affairs in this country is the natural outcome of the custom of society,
  which always recognises the wife as of the husband's status, whatever may
  have been her antecedents, unless the discrepancy is too glaring to be
  overlooked. In England few indeed care or question whether this person or
  that person has even a coat of arms; and in the decision of Society upon
  a given question as to whether this person or the other has "married
  beneath himself," the judgment results solely from the circle in which
  the wife and her people move. By many this curious result is claimed as
  an example of, and as a telling instance to demonstrate, the broad-minded
  superiority of the English race, as evidenced by the equality which this
  country concedes between titled and untitled classes, between official
  and unofficial personages, between the land-owning and the mercantile
  communities. But such a conclusion is most superficial. We draw no
  distinction, and rightly so, between titled and untitled amongst the few
  remaining families who have held and owned their lands for many
  generations; but outside this class the confusion is great, and to a
  close observer it is plainly enough apparent that great distinctions are
  drawn. But they are often mistaken ones. That the rigid and definite
  dividing <!-- Page 619 --><span class="pagenum" title="681.png"><a
  name="page619"></a>{619}</span>line between patrician and plebeian, which
  still exists so much more markedly upon the Continent, can only be traced
  most sketchily in this country is due to two causes&mdash;(1) the fact
  that in early days, when Society was slowly evolving itself, many younger
  sons of gentle families embarked upon commercial careers, natural family
  affection, because of such action, preventing a rigid exclusion from the
  ranks of Society of every one tainted by commerce; (2) the absence in
  this country of any equivalent of the patent distinguishing marks "de,"
  "van," or "von," which exist among our neighbours in Europe.</p>

  <p>The result has been that in England there is no possible way (short of
  specific genealogical investigation) in which it can be ascertained
  whether any given person is of gentle birth, and the corollary of this
  last-mentioned fact is that any real test is ignored. There are few
  families in this country, outside the Roman Catholic aristocracy (whose
  marriages are not quite so haphazard as are those of other people), who
  can show that all their sixteen great-great-grandparents were in their
  own right entitled to bear arms. That is the true definition of the
  "Proof of Seize-Quartiers."</p>

  <p>In other words, to prove Seize-Quartiers you must show this right to
  have existed for</p>

  <p>It should be distinctly understood that there is no connection
  whatever between the list of quarterings which may have been inherited,
  which it is permissible to display, and "Seize-Quartiers," which should
  never be marshalled together or displayed as quarterings.</p>

  <p>Few people indeed in this country can prove the more coveted
  distinction of "Trente Deux Quartiers," the only case that has ever come
  under my notice being that of the late Alfred Joseph, Baron Mowbray,
  Segrave, and Stourton, for whom an emblazonment of his <!-- Page 620
  --><span class="pagenum" title="682.png"><a
  name="page620"></a>{620}</span>thirty-two quarters was prepared under the
  direction of Stephen Tucker, Esq., Somerset Herald.</p>

  <p>After many futile trials (in order to add an existing English
  example), which have only too surely confirmed my opinion as to the
  rarity of "Seize-Quartiers" in this country, it has been found possible
  in the case of the Duke of Leinster, and details of the "proof"
